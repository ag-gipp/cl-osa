The US and Russia are in the throes of a huge disagreement over how to tackle the civil war in Syria.
But in his speech at the Brandenburg gate in Berlin, President Barack Obama declared that he still wants to do business with Vladimir Putin on another security issue – the need to reduce the size of their nuclear arsenals.
One of the foreign policy achievements of Mr Obama's first term was a treaty with Russia in allowing each side a maximum of 1,550 strategic warheads.
Mr Obama has now announced that he wants to cut that by another third – leaving each country with just over 1,000 weapons.
US-Russia arms control is a subject of limited interest to many people these days.
The cold war between Washington and Moscow is over.
Military strategists are far more concerned by tensions between the US and China, especially on cyber espionage.
Even with 1,000 weapons each, the US and Russia would still have the capability to blow the world up many times over.
Still, the ambition spelt out by Mr Obama for more cuts in nuclear weapons does matter for several reasons.
First, the US and Russia have 95 per cent of the world's nuclear weapons between them.
Unless they make further reductions in their arsenals, they will be unable to begin persuading the world's seven other nuclear weapons states to cut their own smaller arsenals.
This matters, especially when we consider the alarming speed with which Pakistan is amassing more and more nuclear warheads.
Secondly, by cutting its own arsenal, Washington is in a slightly better position to argue that Iran and North Korea should stay out of the nuclear weapons game.
In a week in which a more moderate Iranian leader has been elected, the US president's statement that he wants to reduce his own reliance on nuclear weapons even more helps to improve the atmosphere ahead of a new round of talks with Iran.
Thirdly, it is good that Mr Obama and Mr Putin are not allowing differences on Syria to obstruct progress elsewhere.
We should not get ahead of ourselves, of course.
We do not know if Mr Putin will sign a new treaty on arms reductions or whether he will demand more concessions from the US over its missile defence plans, a thorn in the Kremlin's side.
But the Berlin announcement signals that Mr Obama is trying to have a businesslike relationship with Mr Putin even if differences over Syria remain intractable.
