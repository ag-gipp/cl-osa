After 60 days in office – not bad for a Japanese prime minister – Shinzo Abe has not yet screwed up.
By the standards of the five prime ministers who followed him after his own maladroit premiership in 2006-07, that is no mean achievement.
Mr Abe has started off confidently.
His plan to reflate the economy has already borne fruit, if only, so far, in terms of market reaction to anticipated moves.
He has been firm on territorial disputes with China but has managed not to inflame the situation through unnecessary nationalistic posturing.
His trip to the US went well. He even managed to square the circle of committing to negotiations towards the high-level Trans Pacific Partnership without alienating the domestic farm lobby on which his party depends.
From here, though, things will get trickier.
His first task is to clinch the appointment of a Bank of Japan governor willing to pull out all the stops to meet a 2 per cent inflation target.
Options are narrowing.
Internationally, Japan has been warned not to buy foreign bonds since this would be regarded as naked currency intervention.
Domestically, Taro Aso, the finance minister, is resisting a radical appointment.
Mr Abe should hold his nerve by nominating someone willing to be bold in pursuit of mild inflation.
His next step should be to lay out his structural reforms as the third element – in addition to monetary and fiscal stimulus – of his economic revival plan.
Top of the list should be the TPP, which would open up Japan to stiffer competition in return for securing better export markets.
Japan could improve productivity if it dismantled restrictive regulations in sectors such as agriculture, healthcare and energy.
Third comes what Mr Abe should not do.
If his party wins a victory in July's upper house election, he will have set himself up as potentially the most effective prime minister since Junichiro Koizumi in 2001-06.
The danger is he could then blow it by switching aggressively to his real passion: reviving national pride.
Mr Abe would like to water down apologies for Japan's conduct during the second world war, including the industrial use of sex slaves.
He would like to worship at Yasukuni, a controversial shrine seen as a symbol of militarism by neighbouring countries.
Japan has a tradition of postwar prime ministers who put pragmatism above ideology.
If Mr Abe wants to build on his strong start, he should follow suit.
