As a marketing tool, the Brics brand has been a huge success.
It has focused attention on the rising power of five fast-growing economies that account for almost half the world's population and a quarter of its economy.
But for all its sunny show of unity, this week's summit of leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa revealed there is still more that divides these powerful emerging markets than unites them.
Summit statements that condemn violence, call on the developed world to share power with developing countries and urge diplomatic dialogue with Iran are easy to agree.
It is far harder to build common positions on issues such as security when there is deeply-rooted suspicion between Brics members themselves.
Beijing and New Delhi are locked in long-standing border disputes, while Russia is stepping up its military investments to counter China's.
Trust is more difficult to build when political differences span the spectrum from communist to authoritarian to democratic.
It is also challenging to promote mutual prosperity when economies run on different fuels.
The interests of a commodities exporter are quite different from an importer, for example.
There were some encouraging signs at the New Delhi summit, however.
By agreeing to extend credit facilities in their local currencies, Brics members will be able to reduce their dependence on the dollar in trade with each other.
It is also an achievement that, after much procrastinating, Brics members may be ready to consider seriously the idea of funding a development bank of their own.
The potential benefits could be huge, both in freeing up trade between developing countries and spreading the knowledge acquired by the big five to the poorest nations.
The bank will be a test of the Brics countries' commitment to making the alliance work.
They will have to go beyond the rhetoric of unity to deliver funding.
China will have to deal with persistent suspicions over its aims for any shared development fund.
This will take time.
But if the goal of the Brics brand is to match the west's influence in shaping the global world order, its members will have to find a way round their differences.
Brics nations missed an obvious opportunity when they failed to back a single candidate to challenge Washington's stranglehold on the post of World Bank president.
Such cracks prove there is not yet enough mortar in the Brics alliance.
