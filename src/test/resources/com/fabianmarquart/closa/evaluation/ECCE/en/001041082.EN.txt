Europe’s monetary union is at the centre of a financial hurricane now closer than ever to tearing through the world economy and inflicting damage for years to come. 
The eurozone’s challenges are hardly insurmountable. 
The policies needed to end the crisis are hard, but feasible. 
Europe is on the brink because it is unable to muster the political will to do what it must. 

Angela Merkel says if the euro fails Europe fails. 
In truth, it is the other way around: if Europe fails the euro will fail, and uncountable strands in the fabric of European unity, including its single market, will unravel. 
For the rest of the world, too, the implications of European failure are grave. 
Since the onset of the financial crisis there has never been a more urgent need to strengthen the global co-operation and free trade on which prosperity and economic progress everywhere depend. 
The mounting disorder in Europe could throw these efforts into reverse. 
The risks inherent in the euro’s architecture were seriously mismanaged by its members. 
Borrowers lived beyond their means, lenders paid no attention to how credit was spent, and regulators stood by idly. 
The money supply was collectivised while fiscal policy and banking systems stayed national, so sovereign and bank funding problems reinforced each other without the circuit breaker of lending in the last resort. 
The locking of exchange rates could have helped less competitive nations catch up with productivity leaders; instead it allowed massive divergence. 
Repairing the monetary union will require hard labour for years, but the alternative is worse. 
The economic costs of a breakup would be staggering for creditor and debtor nations. 
The political consequences are as grave. 
The euro was portrayed as the last step to rid Europe of the demons of nationalism and war. 
Cracks are already visible in the edifice of European unity – witness the strain on the Schengen visa-free travel scheme. 
The euro’s collapse could bring it down altogether. 

As David Cameron says in today’s FT interview, at least three steps are needed to end the immediate crisis. 
First, leaders must take the Greek problem decisively in hand. 
Aid to Greece should continue, subject to strict conditions. 
But a debt swap should write down private investors by much more than currently envisaged, in return for longer-maturity Brady-type bonds backed by eurozone collateral. 
Without cutting the debt overhang there is scant hope of fresh flows of market finance ever reaching Athens. 
Second, contagion to other sovereigns must be stopped. 
The greatest imminent risk is a funding crisis not for small peripheral countries, but for Italy. 
The eurozone has the means to build a firewall in the form of the European financial stability facility – if the rescue fund obtains the new powers it was promised in July, and if it is leveraged up to several trillion euros. 
Short of that, the European Central Bank will have to continue buying Italian bonds. 
Third, governments in and out of the eurozone must prevent a banking meltdown. 
This is possible only if the sovereign crisis is brought under control. 
Bank rescues must not divert resources from protecting sovereign liquidity. 
The best Europe can do for banks is to subject them to credible stress tests and force more capital on the weakest. 
France should take note. 
Policies to put funding for Europe’s sovereigns and banks on a secure footing cannot wait. 
But wait they will until leaders fill the most serious deficit threatening the euro, that of trust – between countries and between voters and leaders. 
In this respect, Mr Cameron’s intervention is welcome. 
The UK has nothing to gain from the euro’s breakup, but the prime minister is also stating starkly what is needed for its survival. 
Germany, which has much more to lose from a breakup than from putting money behind a solution, should make the case more strongly to its people. 
Leaders have failed to communicate the common interest in keeping the euro together and what it will take to correct the accumulated imbalances. 
Ireland shows that competitiveness can be restored through internal devaluation and reforms. 
But this can take a decade or more, and neither creditor nor debtor countries have been asked for the patience required for a long-term solution. 
The adjustment would be easier if surplus nations were willing to spend. 
It is urgent to retrieve the spirit of 2009 when the Group of 20 nations collectively dragged the world out of recession with fiscal stimulus. 
Germany then pulled its weight: it should do so again in return for austerity efforts elsewhere. 
Above all, leaders must create the political conditions for good policy. 
Monetary union can only survive if each of its members want it to: without voter support Europe will fail. 
The world beholds Europe and sees a region turned in on itself, whose squabbles pose a global economic threat. 
Europeans should realise that their ability to act together determines not just their economic fortunes, but Europe’s hope of relevance and respect on the world stage.
