Renault claims to have fallen victim to a sophisticated case of industrial espionage.
Last week, the carmaker, which is part owned by the French government, suspended three executives following an internal investigation into the suspected theft of secrets from its electric vehicle programme.
Suspicion has fallen on Chinese companies, even though Beijing has vigorously protested its innocence.
There is nothing new about industrial espionage.
As long as trade has existed, merchants have sought to gain an edge on their rivals by fair means and foul.
And states have also often played a role.
In the 1980s, France itself was involved in spying on high-technology companies in the US.
But the level of illicit activity seems to be rising.
In 2009, top- secret data relating to the Pentagon's Joint Strike Fighter project were stolen.
And the same year, about 30 companies were targeted in a highly sophisticated cyber- attack originating in China, during which sensitive data was stolen and e-mail accounts were hacked.
In itself, the dispersal of know-ledge is a good thing.
Theoretically, business innovations would be as widely available as possible.
Individual companies would lose out; but overall, the global economy would benefit.
The problem with the instant dissemination of ideas, however, is that it would weaken the incentive for companies to innovate in the first place.
It is for this reason that property rights must be protected.
That is easier said than done.
Technological advance has made life simpler for the James Bonds of the corporate world.
As the recent WikiLeaks scandal shows, huge amounts of data can now be stored on a small, transportable memory stick.
And as more computers become networked, secret information can be accessed remotely.
Companies can respond by policing better who has access to what information, by ensuring that computers containing sensitive data are not linked to networks, and by sweeping offices for bugs.
But they will always be fighting a rearguard action.
The greatest vulnerability of most businesses, as the Renault case may yet reveal, is their staff.
Personal grievances or financial inducements will always lure some off the straight and narrow.
Given these challenges, countries – both developed and developing – must uphold and enforce intellectual property laws.
China has been lobbying hard for market economy status.
Clamping down on intellectual property theft would be a good way to prove Beijing deserves such recognition.
