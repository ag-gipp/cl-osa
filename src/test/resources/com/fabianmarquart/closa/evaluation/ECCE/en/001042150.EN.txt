Two months into his stint at the helm of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi has followed a fairly orthodox view of the institution's responsibilities and limitations.
As European leaders gathered in Brussels for the latest summit aimed at shoring up the euro, the ECB's new president announced a raft of measures to help the region's deeply troubled banks.
But he signalled that the region's sovereigns would have to look to themselves for salvation.
From December 21, the ECB will launch two new refinancing operations which will last three years and provide unlimited liquidity to European lenders.
The collateral requirements banks must meet to make use of these facilities will also be relaxed.
These are sensible moves.
With â‚¬230bn of eurozone bank debt falling due in the first quarter of 2012 alone, and funding increasingly hard to access for a number of banks, the extra support is sorely needed.
There will be no such help for Europe's sovereigns, however.
Not only did Mr Draghi rule out ramping up the ECB's purchases of European government debt. He also ruled out any attempt to do so on the sly, such as by funnelling ECB money to the IMF and allowing it to do the purchasing.
Given legal constraints, and the intense political divisions among eurozone governments about the role the ECB should play in resolving the crisis, it would be unfair to criticise Mr Draghi for playing safe.
Those who interpreted his remarks last week as a sign that he might countenance more radical measures will be disappointed.
But there was never an easy quid pro quo for ECB activism in return for new rules on European Union-wide fiscal discipline.
With the ECB's big bazooka still held in reserve, the burden of restoring credibility in the eurozone will fall more heavily on member states themselves.
That effectively means deeper austerity in low-growth countries such as Italy and Spain.
Yet unless states in the eurozone's core are also prepared to do their bit, there is a danger that the result will merely be lower growth and lower revenues.
The eurozone would then be trapped in a vicious circle requiring further cuts to restore budgets to balance.
This is precisely the dynamic that Europe's leaders need to break.
The proposals mooted this week by Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy gave little indication that they are ready to do so.
It is to be hoped that today's summit produces something a good deal more convincing.
