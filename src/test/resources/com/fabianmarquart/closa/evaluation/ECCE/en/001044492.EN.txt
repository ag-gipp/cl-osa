Mariano Rajoy, Spanish prime minister, insisted when he came to office that not one euro more of taxpayers' money would be used to bail out the banking sector.
But the meltdown at Bankia, the savings bank that holds 10 per cent of the country's deposits, has forced Mr Rajoy to confront the bull elephant in his room.
Despite raising €23bn since the collapse of the property market, Spain's banking sector remains woefully undercapitalised.
The government's programme of forced consolidation and €54bn in compulsory writedowns may have put pressure on banks to begin facing up to the excesses of their decade-long property binge.
But it still failed to address the true extent of the sector's property problems.
As the recession bites, property and land prices are melting; now even the value of previously performing loans is in doubt.
Mr Rajoy is planning to address the issue with a new demand for writedowns, this time on performing loans.
The plan is to call for a further €30bn in provisions across the sector.
The risk is that even this will not be enough.
Spanish banks still have an estimated €180bn in questionable property loans on their balance sheets.
While Madrid is right to call for a more aggressive cull of bad loans, its move to restore confidence in the banking sector as a whole has left it with little choice but to rescue Bankia.
Created in 2010 from the merger of seven troubled regional savings banks, the group was already too fragile to take the required initial hit on its mountain of troubled property assets.
The obvious move would have been for the government to stick to its word and refuse to bail Bankia out.
Bankia should even be the ideal candidate for a banking resolution scheme, were that possible.
But the political fallout of letting Spain's fourth-largest regional bank go to the wall would have been intolerable for a government already struggling to contain a backlash to austerity.
Even creating a bad bank to take on Bankia's toxic assets would require government support.
Either way, taxpayers would foot the bill.
As one of the banks with the biggest portfolio of questionable assets, Bankia also poses a serious threat to restoring confidence in Spain's financial sector.
Two weeks ago, the International Monetary Fund warned that the regional banks – or cajas – still posed a threat to financial stability.
No names were mentioned but Bankia was the obvious target.
Nonetheless, investors who bought shares in the banks flotation last year have a right to be incensed.
The float was little more than a cosmetic exercise designed to show that structural reforms had worked, even though it raised nothing like enough to meet capital needs.
Thousands of ordinary depositors were wooed into buying shares through the group's formidable local branch network.
Those investments are now worth a fraction of their value.
Elsewhere this would prompt calls for an inquiry into questionable selling practices.
Not in Spain, it seems.
