Jacob Zuma, South Africa's president and hitherto an evangelist of China's role in Africa, has warned an Africa-China summit that his continent needs to “be cautious when entering into partnerships with other economies”.
Africans may legitimately worry about their trading patterns with the world's second economy – but Mr Zuma and other African leaders are best placed to address these concerns.
Mr Zuma is right that a trade relationship based mainly on supplying China with unrefined raw materials is undesirable “in the long term”.
Africa's deepening integration with the world economy should not lock it into a role in China's supply chain – and a low value-added role at that.
For now, however, the balance of China's engagement with Africa is positive.
The continent has had a good decade of strong growth. It would be wrong to dismiss China's contribution to this – through financing, infrastructure construction, and the often neglected benefit of affordable manufactures.
There are, of course, dark sides to trade flows that have grown from very little to $166bn a year.
They include cultural frictions, resentment at Chinese labour that keeps locals out of new jobs, and China's lack of concern about corruption and power abuse – just when western companies are starting to clean up their acts.
But here African leaders bear the greatest responsibility.
Chinese lending will most probably be wasted in countries with the worst governance.
Angola, for example, has mortgaged future oil but already landed itself with white elephants.
The rest of the world cannot wash its hands. China in particular must take responsibility for the impact of its presence in Africa.
Libya and Sudan show that the days when Beijing could be indifferent to corrupt or dysfunctional government in Africa are over.
Both China and the rich world should keep an open door to African manufacturing exports by maintaining or deepening trade preferences such as the US's African Growth and Opportunity Act.
But Africa's destiny is in African hands above all.
Its leaders should manage relations with China for long-term advantage, for example by pushing for more skills transfer in construction, and infrastructure that benefits the wider economy as well as Chinese supply routes.
And they should put their countries in a position to climb the productivity ladder.
A growing number of success stories prove Africa's potential.
Fair and efficient institutions, and investments in health and education, will best realise it.
