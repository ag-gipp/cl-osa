This week's bad news for European non-fossil energy proves governments still have hard choices to make for a long-term energy strategy that fits the economics of the industry and the interdependence of their own decisions.
In Germany, a shift to more meagre subsidies for solar power generation is putting a brake on its expansion.
Electricity networks are struggling to adapt transmission patterns to a scaling down of nuclear power that is quicker than expected before last year's Fukushima disaster.
In Britain, plans to build two nuclear reactors fell into disarray when German utilities Eon and RWE decided to pull out their joint venture Horizon.
The ditching of Horizon brings out the interdependence of European national energy policies: it is blamed on Germany's abrupt decision to get out of nuclear fast, which is sapping Eon's and RWE's balance sheets to the point where they cannot bear the long-term burden of the UK nuclear plants.
The economics of nuclear energy looks unattractive in two ways.
It needs the most frontloaded investments of any industry: plants are inordinately costly and can take decades to start paying back.
Pension funds could face such profiles of returns – but not the planning and construction risks.
Markets fail to split up and distribute risks and returns to investors that can bear them.
Governments can help co-ordinate this process, but a second problem remains: especially after Fukushima, returns may simply be too low given the costs.
This threat to nuclear's viability is exacerbated by an abundance of natural gas.
Companies cannot be blamed for shying away from nuclear projects if gas power looks faster, cheaper and more profitable.
But governments should beware: a gas outlook that changes so fast can change again.
A long-term strategy should still rely on securing a mix of gas, nuclear and renewables.
What can governments do?
Certainty about future regulation and policies to match investor preferences with financing needs are useful.
A more integrated European energy infrastructure and co-ordinated policies would permit a more liquid market – one easier for intermittent wind and solar generation to sell into.
How valuable a nuclear power supply is to society must also be decided, as it may require more public funds and a bigger state role in providing it.
Any plausible strategy will lead to higher costs to consumers.
But if politicians do not act now in fear of voters' wrath, stagnating supply could push prices higher still.
