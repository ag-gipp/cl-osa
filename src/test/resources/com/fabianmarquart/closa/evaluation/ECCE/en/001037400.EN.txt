In the aftermath of November's mid-term elections, the sound of Republicans crowing could be heard across the US.
After wresting back control of the House of Representatives from the Democrats, and coming within a whisker of regaining the Senate, Republican luminaries were falling over themselves to predict that the White House would be in Republican hands after 2012.
The severity of the voters' verdict on two years of Democratic dominance in Washington prompted President Barack Obama, to concede that his party had taken a “shellacking”.
So it is striking that barely five months on, the main contenders for the Republican nomination are coy about their plans for 2012.
At this stage in the last electoral cycle, there were already eight Republican and 10 Democratic declarations.
This time around, more Republicans have ruled themselves out than in.
Admittedly, back in 2007, the incumbent president could not stand again.
But the first primary is less than a year away.
That is not long for aspiring White House occupants to organise and raise funds.
This reticence is not due to a sudden outbreak of modesty among Republican hopefuls.
Despite November's drubbing, Mr Obama retains formidable advantages.
Only three sitting presidents have been ditched by voters since the second world war and, though his first two years have been difficult, Mr Obama's approval rating remains at about 48 per cent.
Moreover, the president is among the best fundraisers American politics has seen.
Running against him will not be cheap.
A more capricious factor that could work in Mr Obama's favour is the economy.
Though jerky and fragile, growth is starting to pick up.
True, $100-oil will do the economy no favours, and unemployment remains stubbornly high at 8.9 per cent.
But jobless figures recently nudged downwards, and hiring is spreading across a range of industries.
If he is lucky, the economy may have turned decisively in time for re-election, though the jobless rate will remain critical to the outcome.
The luxuries of undeclared candidacy may also be slowing Republican contenders: declared candidates face limits on fundraising activities and media exposure; they also need policies of their own, not just a knack of criticising those of others.
But perhaps the most important factor is the Tea Party's emergence.
The Republicans have always had to juggle the competing demands of appealing to independents as well as their highly charged base.
But the Tea Party's radicalism will make this trick especially difficult in 2012.
Centrist Republicans may calculate that it would be easier to wait four years, when the Tea Party's appeal may have ebbed.
It would be a shame if such considerations robbed the Republicans of a credible candidate.
Big issues are at stake in 2012, and on some of them, Mr Obama is vulnerable.
Most glaring is the US's fiscal position.
Despite receiving a plausible blueprint from the Bowles-Simpson commission, Mr Obama has yet to lay out a credible plan to cut the US's ballooning deficit.
The cuts he proposed in his budget fell about $3,000bn short of par.
Republican proposals are hardly more convincing.
But the party has both serving and former governors who have made a good fist of balancing the books at state level, including Chris Cristie in New Jersey, Mitch Daniels in Indiana, and Mitt Romney in Massachussets.
The Republican primaries will have served their party well if they produce a candidate who recognises that the solution to the US's fiscal woes must involve tax rises as well as spending cuts, and that Medicare cannot be exempted from these.
If this drives Mr Obama to start serious bargaining over the deficit, Americans voting in 2012 will have the luxury of picking between two credible alternatives.
