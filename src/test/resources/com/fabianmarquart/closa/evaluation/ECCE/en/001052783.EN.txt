When he won a second term as prime minister last December, Shinzo Abe vowed to fight Japan's economic malaise with “three arrows”. 
The first two – a hefty fiscal stimulus and an unprecedented monetary loosening – were fired swiftly and look set to hit the target. 
The third – structural reforms – remains stuck in Mr Abe's quiver.
Unshackling the supply side of Japan's economy is essential if “Abenomics” is to succeed. 
Inflationary expectations have begun to pick up on the back of the Bank of Japan's monetary largesse. 
Eventually, investors will demand a higher interest rate to compensate for rising prices. 
Without sustained growth, Tokyo's debt mountain – currently a staggering 230 per cent of gross domestic product – could quickly become unsustainable.
Last June the prime minister unveiled a checklist of vague promises – including a deregulating agenda – which left investors unimpressed. 
However, markets gave him the benefit of the doubt. 
The hope was that Mr Abe would become more daring after the upper house elections, held in July. 
Yet in spite of securing a majority, he has remained cautious. 
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Abe ruled out a speedy liberalisation of the labour market, as he feared strong domestic opposition.
However, labour market reform is necessary if the government is serious about lifting growth. 
In Japan, employment laws make it almost impossible to fire regular workers. 
Companies seeking to lower costs and increase flexibility have hired ever more employees on temporary terms, creating what economists refer to as a “dual labour market”.
These arrangements are manifestly unfair. 
Temporary workers are paid less than their colleagues on permanent contracts and rarely receive pension benefits. 
They are also inefficient. 
In a dual labour market, age, not talent, determines who has a permanent job. 
Companies have little reason to train workers who may be on their staff for a few months only. 
This has a damping effect on productivity.
Mr Abe has not lost all of his initial reformist zeal. 
He is displaying an admirable commitment to open up the Japanese economy to outside competition by joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks. 
But his agenda abroad must be matched by equally ambitious domestic reforms. 
Without them, the initial enthusiasm among investors for his “three arrows” may quickly disappear.
