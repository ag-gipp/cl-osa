The American people will decide whether by adding Congressman Paul Ryan to his ticket, Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for president, has become more likely to prevail against president Barack Obama in November.
What is clear is that Mr Romney's bold choice for the vice-presidential slot will focus the campaign on the issues that US voters need to debate.
Mr Romney has long struggled to convince voters about what he stands for.
Some of his record as governor is difficult to square with attacks on Mr Obama, whose healthcare law resembles the statewide health programme introduced by Mr Romney in Massachusetts.
In the Republican primaries, Tea Party supporters who never accepted Mr Romney as a true believer in their principles, often called for “anyone but Romney”.
Mr Ryan, in contrast, is anything but undefined. He is a conservative of the libertarian kind, who comes across as deeply committed to much smaller government.
He may be able to energise the Republican-leaning voters who have remained cool on Mr Romney.
For a challenger's campaign that remains on the defensive against the White House, this is a shrewd choice.
It is also a gamble.
Mr Ryan, who chairs the House of Representatives' budget committee, is best known for a proposal for fiscal reform that is more specific than what most politicians dare to put forward, and much more radical.
It involves swingeing cuts both to popular entitlement programmes such as Medicare and non-entitlement ones such as defence.
While Mr Ryan's plan is not the official platform for the presidential ticket, it will put Mr Romney and his new running mate under immediate and intense scrutiny.
Democrats will lose no time before attacking the Romney-Ryan team over the more incendiary features of the Ryan plan, as well as what it leaves unanswered, such as how to finance large tax cuts.
This is good.
America is running out of time to decide how to husband its resources.
While the US can and should run a large deficit until the economy recovers, deep reforms are needed in the medium term – including entitlement cuts, but also tax rises.
The Ryan pick will make it harder to dodge a serious debate about the responsibilities and reach of the federal government and whether economic dynamism is best stoked by inequity rather than equity.
Whether or not Mr Ryan's candidacy is good for America or even for the Romney campaign, it will be good for the conversation that America needs to have with itself.
