Since taking office in the spring, the new Chinese leadership knew it had to boost a slowing economy, while, at the same time, rebalancing it away from state-driven investment.
Some of the measures included in the “mini-stimulus” Beijing announced on Wednesday strike this difficult balance.
The package, which temporarily scraps taxes for smaller companies and slashes red tape for exporters, is much smaller than the gargantuan monetary stimulus provided in 2008.
This restraint looks right.
Manufacturing surveys for July showed the lowest reading in almost a year – a sign the slowdown is continuing.
But year-on-year growth in the three months to June was still a steady 7.5 per cent – in line with what both the leadership and analysts expected.
The other important aspect of this week's expansion is that it bypasses government, putting cash straight into the pockets of entrepreneurs.
This shows that China is learning from its mistakes.
The 2008 stimulus was largely channelled through local governments, which used the money to finance many unproductive projects.
Beijing has to ensure its provinces deal with their old debts, not saddle them with new ones.
Conversely, helping small and medium-sized enterprises makes economic sense.
China's SMEs are a key driver of growth and source of employment.
Yet throughout the past two decades they have been penalised in favour of state-owned enterprises.
Since larger companies are finding it hard to invest in productive projects, targeting SMEs is a more effective and sustainable way to boost the economy.
For SMEs to flourish, however, China's credit market has to stop favouring larger companies.
In the three months to June, only a third of bank loans went to small firms.
Last week the government took a step towards financial liberalisation, scrapping a decades-old floor on lending rates.
The move, however, is largely symbolic, since most loans are priced above the floor.
Anyway, if anyone is going to benefit from this reform it will be state-owned enterprises, which can borrow more cheaply.
A more meaningful step would be to scrap the central bank-enforced lending quotas.
Letting the money flow to the most promising projects, regardless of the borrower's size, would damage inefficient state-owned enterprises.
But since other firms would be in the position to borrow freely, capital would be allocated more efficiently.
This would help the SMEs and China's economy as a whole.
