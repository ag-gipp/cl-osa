As the average cost of petrol in the US edges ever closer to $4 a gallon, it is little wonder that Barack Obama has become increasingly nervous about oil prices.
Expensive gasoline does not just infuriate American voters when they refill their cars at the pump.
It may also risk undermining the economic recovery, which the Democrats hope will secure him a second term in the White House.
Among the options President Obama has on his table, one involves drawing on the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
This reserve comprises roughly 700m barrels of oil buried in vast salt caverns along the coast of Texas and Louisiana.
For all the pressures from fellow Democrats, President Obama would be better advised to leave the reserves undisturbed.
Oil from the SPR has been sold on only three occasions to contain spikes.
The first two interventions occurred during the first Gulf war in 1991 and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
These were, on balance, successful.
But these crises were resolved in a reasonable time.
Conversely, the release of 30m barrels ordered last summer to compensate for lost supply from Libya had only a short-term effect â€“ and a relatively small one at that.
The current situation resembles more what happened last summer than either of the two other instances.
The spike is largely due to rising tensions with Iran, which have prompted the European Union to impose an oil embargo from July.
While the release of oil from the SPR may have a short-term effect on the price of crude, continuing political tensions are bound to drive it up again.
If he were to resort to this emergency safeguard too early, Mr Obama may also weaken his hand vis-a-vis Tehran.
The strategic reserve is meant to be used in the event of a genuine calamity.
This would be, for example, a decision by Iran to shut the Strait of Hormuz, through which one-third of the world's seaborne oil trade passes.
With Tehran threatening to close this vital waterway, the de-pletion of US oil reserves may only make Americans more vulnerable.
If he wants to do his country a favour, Mr Obama's aim should be to make the US less dependent on imported oil.
Over the long term, shale gas and oil production could prove to be viable alternatives.
Boosting energy efficiency could also prove helpful.
What the US needs is a debate on energy policy, not the deployment of an ineffective and potentially harmful election weapon.
