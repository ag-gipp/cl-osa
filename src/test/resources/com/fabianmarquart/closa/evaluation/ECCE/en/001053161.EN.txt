The US National Security Agency has been repeatedly embarrassed this year by details of its extensive surveillance operations exposed by Edward Snowden, the former contractor.
None of these revelations is diplomatically as damaging as his disclosure that the NSA has listened for most of the past decade to the mobile phone conversations of Angela Merkel, the German chancellor.
The revelation has triggered deep anger in Berlin while the US has in effect admitted that the allegation is true.
Exactly why the NSA decided to start bugging Ms Merkel's phone, and what intelligence it hoped to glean, remains a mystery.
But the NSA's decision, certainly after she attained power, was reckless.
All nations spy on each other, and even on their allies.
But in this case, any intelligence gains were bound to be minuscule when set against the immense damage that any future disclosure would inevitably do to US-German relations.
The damage is hard to overstate.
This is not just the US bugging a head of government who happens to be a close ally and Europe's pivotal leader. She also grew up under the German Democratic Republic and the surveillance of the Stasi secret police. She is right to regard this revelation as a serious breach of trust.
It also damages longstanding US policy in Europe.
For years, the US has called on Germany and other EU states to bear a greater share of the burden in managing global security.
The US will not win a respectful hearing on this or other issues when its intelligence services abuse European leaders.
This phone-tapping revelation, like others arising from Mr Snowden, raises concerns about the NSA's power and its unchecked authority.
The US must give a firm political assurance to allies that this power is being reined in.
Mr Snowden's leaks must still be seen in context.
The low-level contractor has breached US and British intelligence on a scale that is immense and whose implications remain unclear.
Security chiefs are right to worry that continued revelations from his huge trove of purloined data will damage counter-terrorism efforts.
Moreover, the threat to European governments and businesses from US snooping is minor when compared with that from espionage by China and Russia.
China is allegedly stealing intellectual property from the west on a large scale.
Ms Merkel is right to be enraged over US snooping. But she and other European leaders must not forget where today's other cyber threats are coming from.
