The greatest threat to global financial stability today is the eurozone debt crisis.
Europe can and should contain this threat by itself, for its own sake and that of world economy.
But this is no reason to turn down the International Monetary Fund's request for increased resources.
Financial stability is a global public good, and the Fund's members should equip it to safeguard that good without abdicating their own responsibilities.
The IMF's firepower lags behind the enormous growth of cross-border financial flows, even after the Group of 20 leading economies agreed to triple its resources three years ago.
To do its job, the Fund needs to be able to address a sovereign debt crisis in a large economy.
The $387bn it has at its immediate disposal is not enough: a lending capacity in the order of $1tn is necessary.
This may be a tall order; it is depressing if that is so.
The IMF is funded by its member states, which should not find it difficult to oblige.
Many emerging countries are flush with surpluses, and in any case new resources can take the form of arrangements for the IMF to borrow from members when it needs to rather than upfront contributions.
A more attractive funding option still is for the IMF membership to accept issuance of new Special Drawing Rights, the IMF's pseudo-currency.
This would have the side benefit of additional global monetary easing.
The real obstacle is political.
Many countries fear that the IMF will serve as a mere conduit to the eurozone.
Their frustration with the monetary union's dithering is understandable.
But if the eurozone crisis worsens, blaming European ineptitude will do little good: a strong IMF will be better for all.
And the eurozone is not the only financial hot spot in the world.
Financial disruption in China, or of the flows to emerging economies in Asia and Latin America, could cause serious damage for which the IMF would be needed.
The request for more funds for the IMF should not be presented as simply intended to stabilise European sovereign debt markets, nor can it be tied to such an effort.
On the contrary, the IMF should jealously guard its discretion over how deeply it involves itself with the European mess.
It can play a useful role â€“ if it retains the power to set its own tough conditions.
No contribution is expected from the US, which continues its slide from global leadership.
UK leaders are tempted to put domestic politics above global needs.
The times demand better of them: the IMF's call should be heeded universally.
