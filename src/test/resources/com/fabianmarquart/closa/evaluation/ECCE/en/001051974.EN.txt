When Enrique Peña Nieto was elected Mexico's 57th president last year, he promised sweeping reforms that would treble the country's anaemic rate of growth.
Among the key elements of what became the “Pact for Mexico” – a blueprint for change endorsed by all the main political parties – was a commitment in principle to reform the energy sector.
Liberalisation is a big deal.
It has the potential to deliver the biggest shot in Mexico's arm since the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994.
Dominated by a single state-controlled operator since the 1938 nationalisation, the sector has stagnated.
Pemex, the monopolist, has been treated as a cash cow by politicians.
Despite its $100bn of annual revenues, it has struggled to find the wherewithal to invest in exploiting the large reserves Mexico is thought to hold.
Since 2004, oil production has actually fallen by a quarter to 2.5m barrels a day, while Pemex's debt has risen to $60bn.
To accelerate development, Mr Peña Nieto now plans to loosen the company's iron grip.
His vision would leave Pemex in state hands while opening up exploration and development to foreign investors.
The devil, of course, will be in the detail, and it remains to be seen how radical the president will be while carrying political consensus with him.
But the key point is that any reform requires amendments to the Mexican constitution, which currently appropriates all energy activities to state-run institutions.
The political obstacles should not be underestimated.
Lázaro Cárdenas' 1938 expropriation of the oilfields from US and British interests remains one of the founding myths of the modern Mexican state, giving Pemex a place in Mexican hearts akin to that enjoyed by the National Health Service in Britain.
Encouraging foreign entry while reassuring Mexicans that they are not being stripped of their hydrocarbons requires a delicate balancing act.
Mr Peña Nieto is right to separate the larger political battle from the line-item haggling over whatever licence regime ensues.
He must bring the other parties with him – a process that will no doubt involve complex trade-offs in other areas, notably fiscal and political reforms.
The Pact for Mexico has sometimes been criticised for reducing much-needed economic reform to its lowest common denominator.
But if it gives Mr Peña Nieto the means to wean Mexico off 75 years of energy protectionism, the pact and the president will have done the state a service.
