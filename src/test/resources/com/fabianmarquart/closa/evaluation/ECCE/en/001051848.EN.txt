As the billionaire founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos struck terror into the hearts of traditional publishers.
Now, as the new owner of the troubled Washington Post, he has a foot in both camps.
The sale ends eight decades of ownership by the Graham family, a glittering newspaper dynasty that married civic duty with the courage to defend journalism against the arrogance of power.
Their near monopoly in Washington shielded journalists from commercial pressures, too: the newsroom once numbered more than 1,000 journalists and unearthed scandals such as Watergate, which for better or worse turned journalists into celebrities.
But as with other US newspapers, a captive audience may have dulled the incentive to experiment and innovate.
Unlike its arch rival The New York Times, the Post abandoned its national ambitions and become a metropolitan daily.
By the time the internet swept a kaleidoscope of content on to readers' screens, the title was dangerously close to becoming an anachronism.
Its top brass were slow to grasp the need for change.
The newspaper that Mr Bezos is acquiring is losing $50m annually; sales have declined in each of the past seven years.
Pulling out of this death spiral will take a transformation no less drastic than the one Mr Bezos wrought on bookselling.
That will require the entrepreneurial spark that created Amazon and the technological vision to come up with the Kindle tablet e-reader.
His strengths are innovation – and patience.
These are virtues that should serve him well as he seeks to revive the Post.
Mr Bezos has pledged to respect the newspaper's independence – a reassuring sign given Amazon's power as a publisher and distributor.
The attractions of newspaper ownership are nowhere near as strong as when Eugene Meyer bought the Post in 1933; but the brand still has lustre.
As a fellow actor in the news business, we hope this is not the end but a new beginning.
