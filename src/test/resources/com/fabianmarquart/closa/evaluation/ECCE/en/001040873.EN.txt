The country that coined the term “currency wars” has just added to its rhetorical arsenal.
Brazil wants the World Trade Organisation to allow “exchange rate anti-dumping measures”, which would let Brasilia retaliate against countries that undertake competitive devaluations of their currencies via ultra- easy monetary policies.
The proposal does not stand a chance.
But it is a worrying sign of the kind of protectionism the world has so far avoided in four years of financial crisis and recession.
Although its currency has weakened recently, Brazil is worried that the real might shoot even higher should the US and the UK and embark on more quantitative easing.
As Brasilia sees it, that would make it the innocent victim in Currency Wars Part II.
Yet Brazil's strong exchange rate remains largely its own fault.
Last year, the government spent freely before presidential elections.
BNDES, a state development bank, spewed out cheap credit.
When the economy overheated, the central bank was compelled to jack up interest rates higher than it would otherwise have had to.
This attracted massive capital inflows – which, in turn, pushed up the real.
Brazil shot itself in the foot, but blamed others for the injury.
Worse, for political reasons, it has often blamed the wrong country: the US.
Yet it is cheap Chinese imports, not American ones, that are hollowing out Brazil's industrial base.
In fact, Brazil has much to gain if the Federal Reserve's monetary policies work.
A stronger US economy would spur demand for Chinese manufactured imports, which would in turn support Brazil's commodity exports to China.
The US is also a major Brazilian market in its own right.
Brazil's accomplished trade diplomats surely know that its WTO ploy will get nowhere.
Establishing what counts as an undervalued or manipulated currency is a nightmare.
Brazil has suggested the International Monetary Fund as arbiter, but the IMF would never get involved in that fight.
Rewriting WTO laws that determine which subsidies are disallowed would also require all members to agree – a virtual impossibility.
This permits the thought that Brazil's plan is an elaborate ruse.
Inevitable rejection by the WTO could lead to feigned disappointment, then unilateral protectionism followed by a trade war.
As a harbinger of future skirmishes, Brazil recently slapped tariffs on imported cars.
Brazil likes to play the peacemaker when it is not acting the victim.
This time, it needs to step back and think again.
