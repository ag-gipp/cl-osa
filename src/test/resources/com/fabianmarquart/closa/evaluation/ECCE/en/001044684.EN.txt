Whichever way one looks at it, April really was the cruelest month for China's economy.
Industrial production, investment and retail spending were all much weaker than expected.
With trade data also showing a sharp deceleration, it is no surprise that China's premier, Wen Jiabao, has pledged that his government will do more to revive growth.
Optimists say there is no obvious reason to worry about China's economy.
According to the official statistics, in the first quarter of 2012 the economy expanded 8.1 per cent.
While marking a slowdown compared with the end of 2011, such figures are the envy of almost every other country in the world.
The problem is that analysts are finding it increasingly hard to take official growth figures seriously.
China has a history of manipulating statistics for political reasons and, as the economy slows down, the temptation to conceal the truth could grow even bigger.
This is of course self-defeating.
Obfuscating data is never a good way to build confidence in an economy, whatever its growth rates.
What Beijing should do instead is to find ways to reinvigorate its economy.
To some extent, it is already doing so.
Over the past fortnight it has reduced the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves. It also unveiled subsidies for the purchase of energy-saving white goods.
These measures are unlikely to have a huge impact.
And while the government has said it will do more, there is no reason to believe Beijing will embark on a monetary stimulus comparable to the one unleashed in 2008.
As China is still struggling to contain the long-term impact of that credit frenzy, this would be a wise decision.
In order to stimulate growth that is sustainable, the government should encourage consumer spending â€“ cutting taxes or increasing the size of its welfare safety net.
This could also help China rebalance its economy.
While the weight of investment on national income is slowly decreasing, it remains too high.
Another move would be to reform the banking sector so that credit flows to small and medium-sized enterprises.
As we report in our analysis today, too many bank loans go to large, politically connected enterprises.
Pilot projects such as the one conducted in Wenzhou should pave the way for larger-scale reform.
This year's slowdown could be a seed for future troubles or a platform for greater successes.
It will be up to Mr Jiabao and his successor to decide which is the case.
