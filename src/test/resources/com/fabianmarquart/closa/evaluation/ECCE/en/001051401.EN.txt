GlaxoSmithKline has become the latest pharmaceuticals company to be accused of paying bribes to win business in China.
In the past year, Eli Lilly and Pfizer have reached settlements with US authorities over similar allegations concerning their conduct in China.
While GSK says it has found no evidence of bribery in its Chinese business, a thorough investigation should establish whether the company has done anything wrong.
Clearly, there is no excuse for suborning local officials and doctors.
But the allegations also point to a deeper malaise in China's healthcare system.
As China grows richer, its people are coming to expect better healthcare.
Yet the government does not pay hospitals enough to cover the cost of treating patients, leaving a shortfall that must be made up elsewhere.
Patients who cannot afford to pay often struggle to get treatment.
Even the luckier ones sometimes endure unnecessary procedures, peddled by hospitals seeking extra fees.
Drugs, to which healthcare providers add a 15 per cent mark-up as a source of income, are liberally prescribed.
Doctors, too, are disgruntled.
They struggle to make ends meet on wages that are low even by Chinese standards, and complain of being held in low esteem.
In a country in which bribery remains a problem, hardship among doctors makes it almost inevitable that some will look for kickbacks to supplement their meagre incomes.
None of this excuses improper conduct by drugs companies or the medical profession.
Still, enforcing the law is only part of the solution.
There are powerful incentives for misbehaviour, which must be removed.
That will take money.
Here, as elsewhere, the government must do more to meet the rising expectations of its citizens, and tackle the glaring inequality of Chinese society.
Institutional change is also needed.
Most western healthcare systems appoint a central authority to decide which treatments are effective and offer value for money.
China should do the same.
It should also emulate western efforts to use cheap generic drugs whenever they are available.
In the past, prosecutors in the west have often been behind high-profile investigations into corrupt business practices in China.
It is natural that Chinese authorities should grow more assertive in policing their own turf.
But China also needs a healthcare system that provides for its citizens without inviting malfeasance.
