Markets sighed with relief at the gloomy economic data coming out of China yesterday.
True, the purchasing managers' index published by HSBC fell to 48.2 in June, a nine-month low.
Yet, after last month's cash crunch, in which interbank rates spiked to double-digit levels, investors had braced for even bleaker news.
The stock market in Shanghai was unmoved, closing the day up 0.8 per cent.
China's slowdown, however, is only going to get worse.
The interbank lending market is functioning again thanks to the intervention of the People's Bank of China.
But the authorities are still determined to rein in credit, which has grown extremely fast so far this year.
Indicators of companies' borrowing costs are still higher than they were a month ago.
Several analysts fear that China may miss its own gross domestic product growth target for 2013, which stands at 7.5 per cent.
Slower growth is a price worth paying to end China's credit binge.
A new monetary stimulus after the one in 2008-09 would offer temporary relief to the economy.
But it would also lead to a new property boom.
Local governments and, increasingly, retail investors are heavily exposed to the construction sector.
Reinflating the bubble could have catastrophic outcomes.
After two decades of fast growth, however, the leadership will find it hard to manage a slowdown.
The sheer size of the economy makes this task even tougher.
Were property prices to fall too fast and investment demand to plummet rather than decrease gently, China would face a violent boom-and-bust cycle.
There would be consequences for the solvency of local authorities, which the central government may have to bail out.
Beijing wants to rebalance the economy away from exports and investment and towards consumption.
This is a sensible plan.
But giving a greater role to individuals over large state-own enterprises will prove politically difficult.
Demands for greater democracy are bound to get louder.
A bumpy slowdown in China would affect others too.
Resource-rich countries, which have enjoyed a long boom thanks to China's hunger for commodities, will have to find a different economic model.
Western companies that have relied on strong Chinese demand to make up for slow growth in the US and Europe would also suffer.
Yet the longer the leadership waits before embarking on the transition, the harder it is to manage it.
China is right to begin its march to a new model.
The rest of the world should wish it well.
