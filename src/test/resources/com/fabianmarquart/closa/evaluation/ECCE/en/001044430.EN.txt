Barack Obama launched his re-election campaign at the weekend.
Americans could be forgiven for failing to spot the difference.
Having attended almost 200 fundraising events so far, which is more at this point than his four predecessors combined, Mr Obama will step it up another notch.
Let us hope he also raises the quality.
Neither he nor Mitt Romney have done much to enlighten the electorate so far.
Their biggest failing is common: neither has credibly specified how they would handle the fiscal reckoning that falls due before the end of the year.
Dubbed “taxmaggedon” by some, Congress faces a quartet of choices that will set America's course for years to come.
These include another increase in the sovereign ceiling, the expiration of all the Bush-era tax cuts, a $1,200bn “sequestration” if lawmakers fail to agree on a fiscal plan, and the end of the payroll tax cut and extended benefits for the jobless.
A wrong turn on one or more of these could plunge the US back into recession.
An intelligent approach, which is asking a lot of Congress nowadays, could restore US growth on to a fiscally sustainable path.
Both candidates have failed to offer a realistic account of what should done.
Both are happy to say how they would distribute whatever gains are to be had from their fiscal plans.
Neither say how they would distribute the pain.
America needs a more honest debate than this.
Mr Obama's new slogan, “Forward”, eschews the lofty tone of the 2008 “Change you can believe in”.
Yet he offers little by way of content.
Much of his rhetoric is about the proposed “Buffett tax” that would impose a 30 per cent annual minimum on millionaires.
It is a gimmick that would barely scratch the surface of America's fiscal deficit.
If anything, Mr Romney's fiscal plan is vaguer than that of the president.
Not only would he reduce everyone's taxes, he would also raise defence spending.
Left unsaid is who would pay for all of this.
The implied cuts both to entitlement and discretionary spending would be huge.
Likewise, while both would simplify the personal and corporate tax codes, neither have set out which loopholes they would eliminate.
It is as though the US were embarking on an era of plenty.
In reality, however, America and Americans are entering a phase of tough fiscal choices.
Pretending that it will be a bonanza is not the way to prepare voters for the road ahead.
