Conflicts of interest are sometimes in the eye of the beholder.
Yet to critics of the US Federal Reserve system the fact that Jamie Dimon is still sitting on the board of the New York Fed looks an open and shut case.
JPMorgan Chase recently lost at least $3bn in derivatives trades that went sour.
There are obvious questions about whether the bank's supervisors were asleep at the wheel.
Even Tim Geithner, who is not known as a scourge of Wall Street, wonders if there is a “perception” problem.
He has a point.
You do not have to agree that the Fed's governance structure amounts to the “fox guarding the henhouse” – as its toughest critics maintain – to accept that appearances are critical to central banks.
Yet it is also important to underline what this is not about.
Mr Dimon has not been accused of wrongdoing, or of any ethical breaches.
JPMorgan lost money because it made a foolish bet.
Mr Dimon may have been lax in his own oversight. But it is the bank's owners, rather than the US taxpayer, that will take the losses.
There is no reason, therefore, to limit our concern solely to Mr Dimon's position on the New York Fed's board.
Rather, this particular appearance of conflict offers a chance to re-evaluate the Fed's governance structure in general.
It must start with two basic facts.
First, the almost 100-year-old system is statutory. Only Congress can overhaul the Fed.
Second, defenders of the system, which gives private sector representation on all 12 regional boards, emphasise that banker-directors are debarred from overseeing supervisory and regulatory issues.
It is also clear the Federal Open Market Committee benefits from the time-sensitive feedback it gets from the real economy.
How then to remove the appearance of conflict while retaining the value built into this structure?
Barney Frank, the Democrat from Massachusetts, wants the Senate to confirm all regional presidencies.
This would risk extending Congressional dysfunction within monetary policy.
Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, would let all 12 presidents vote on the FOMC (from the rotating five today).
But this would only increase the number of perceived conflicts of interest.
Both miss the point.
Rather than aim for more or less private sector representation, Congress should confine such representatives' role to one that is purely advisory.
Other reforms may well be needed.
In this case there is no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater.
