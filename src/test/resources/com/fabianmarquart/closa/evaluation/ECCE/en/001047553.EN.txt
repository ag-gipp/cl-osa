Xi Jinping's first words as general secretary of the Communist party were: “Hello everybody.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.”
He meant the delay in the ceremony at the Great Hall of the People during which China's new leadership team was revealed.
But he could have been referring to the months leading up to this moment, which saw the dramatic purging of Bo Xilai and Mr Xi's own mysterious two-week disappearance.
His opening words, casual and straightforward, set the tone for a speech that contrasted with the mechanical style of Hu Jintao, whom he is replacing.
He talked about the public's hopes for a better life.
The party faced “severe challenges”, he said, mentioning corruption and distance from the people.
His words were blessedly devoid of the ideological sloganeering beloved of his predecessor.
“Socialism with Chinese characteristics” came up only once.
He gave the impression of a modern leader with a lighter touch.
In a break with tradition, Mr Xi also replaced Mr Hu as chairman of the Central Military Commission, which controls the armed forces.
Normally he would have had to wait a year or two.
In March he will also become president of the nation.
This will cap what – despite the distractions of the Bo affair – is the smoothest transition since 1949.
That could augur well for those who see Mr Xi as a potential “reformer”.
Some take hope from the reduction in Standing Committee members from nine to seven.
A smaller body could more easily push through change.
But it would be wrong to get carried away.
Notable absences are the possibly progressive Wang Yang, party secretary of Guangdong province, and Li Yuanchao, head of the organisation department.
Four of the seven members, including Mr Xi, are “princelings”, party royalty not known for embracing radical change.
Whether they prove deeply conservative or reformist, the new team faces long-unaddressed challenges.
The economy is slowing as the investment-led model sputters.
Mr Xi should take on the big state monopolies and put more power into consumers' hands.
He should also accelerate plans to build a viable social security net and a sustainable tax regime to fund it.
China's people are ever-more demanding: as well as growth they want cleaner air, safer trains and less corruption.
Mr Xi should seek to meet these aspirations, not suppress them.
On foreign policy, too, Mr Xi can make an impact.
He should try to patch up relations with Japan after a disastrous deterioration in recent months.
He may also be better equipped to do business with US President Barack Obama, who began his first term by extending the hand of friendship to China but who gradually hardened when he got short shrift.
These are some of the things Mr Xi could do.
But do not hold your breath.
His manner may be refreshing. But until he proves otherwise, it would be prudent to assume that his ultimate objective remains the same as that of his predecessors: to preserve Communist party power.
