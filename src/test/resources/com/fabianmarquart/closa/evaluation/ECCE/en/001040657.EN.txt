Britain's Independent Commission on Banking has presented its final report.
In assessing it, we should bear in mind the damage wreaked on the UK by the crisis: it produces 10 per cent less than it was set to do before the recession; growth is stagnant; taxpayers were put on the hook for hundreds of billions of pounds in possible bank losses; 2.5m people are out of work.
At least part of this is due to a banking system failure that banks were encouraged to court by perverse incentives and implicit subsidies.
The task of Sir John Vickers, ICB chair, and his colleagues was to find ways to lower the risk of it happening again.
They did a good job.
The UK economy and financial system will be healthier and more prosperous if the government implements the ICB proposal – provided it does so in full and swiftly.
This newspaper expressed reservations when it first became clear that the core proposal was to ring-fence retail banks from investment banking and trading activities.
The FT, while not opposed, questioned how much good a ringfence would do, given that deposit-taking banks bent on gambling will always find risky retail investments, and pure investment banks can be systemically as risky as retail banks.
The goal must be to alleviate the too-big-to-fail problem: make banks less failure-prone and limit collateral damage when failure comes.
The good news is that the ICB's final recommendations aim to do exactly that.
The split has earned the bulk of public attention but is mostly an instrument to facilitate more fundamental measures advocated by Sir John: tougher loss-absorption rules and reforms to make bank resolution more workable.
On capital, most striking is the proposal to require 10 per cent equity inside the ringfence, with an option for regulators to demand as much as 13 per cent.
Investment banks will be held to at least the new Basel requirements.
On resolution, a welcome recommendation is depositor preference, which puts insured depositors ahead of senior bondholders in case of insolvency (its absence made the Irish banking crisis less tractable).
Also welcome is the demand to hold 17–20 per cent of loss-absorbing capital including bonds that regulators have explicit authority to “bail in”.
These rules could be put in place without a ringfence. But they are stronger with one.
Capital inside the ringfence is dedicated to vital economic functions – the payment system and retail deposit taking – and investment banking losses will not eat into it.
The proposal that separate boards govern activities within and outside the ringfence also facilitates carving up assets as needed in an orderly resolution.
Why not split the banks up altogether?
The ICB pays lip service to the synergies of universal banking.
But the fence is high enough that it creates full separation in all but name.
An integrated bank's shareholders may well prefer a full legal split, and make their own choice as to whether to hold both parts.
The ICB puts the annual cost to banks around £6bn.
This is modest as a share of banks' assets (0.1 per cent). It would even be a small 0.4 per cent of UK output – but it should not be seen as a social cost even if passed on to customers.
The “cost” reflects the removal of a taxpayer subsidy to systemic banks.
If anything, other estimates of the subsidy's size – 10 times bigger or more – suggest Sir John has offered the banks a bargain.
Still, the reform is radical.
It will force big changes on the City: existing business models may not be viable under the new rules.
But if the City carries out fewer activities that put Britain in danger, we should welcome it, as we should welcome the talent and expertise in the City being put to better use.
Other countries would do well to study Vickers.
If more states insulate their domestic banking systems, they should find it easier to agree how to regulate cross-border behemoths.
The big European governments are, however, unlikely to abandon their universal banks.
That means the Vickers plan does not have time on its side.
For now, the single market in retail banking works better in theory than in practice but, sooner or later, European banks will try to poach UK retail business and weaken the effect of Vickers rules that apply only to UK banks.
That is a case for implementing them while they do the most good. The government took power with a mandate to tame a banking system turned monster.
Full implementation should not wait until 2019, as has been proposed.
Needed legislation can be expedited and the rules put into effect by the end of this parliament.
Politicians can then face voters having made the UK a model of responsible banking instead of a paragon of privatising rewards from socialised risk.
