Soon the Greek crisis will return to the headlines: a bond redemption fall due next week and the creditors' troika of enforcers will at some point give their verdict on whether Athens' performance is sufficient for another tranche of rescue loans.
These are opportunities for more bad news, especially when the latest figures show the economy shrinking by an abysmal 6.2 per cent since one year ago.
Two things are crucial.
The Greek government that gained power in June must prove that it will, unlike its predecessors, be serious about the rot in the state's management of the economy.
And if it does, then its creditors must give Athens a chance to succeed.
There is some sign of the first, though the jury is still out.
The government has yet to identify all the €11.5bn of new cuts it promises to make.
But a new debt sustainability analysis emerging out of Athens indicates an active interest in understanding what it takes to right the ship that has so far been lacking.
Moreover, it makes some valid points that Greece's helpers would do well to ponder.
The analysis takes on board the all-important fact of a much deeper recession than the adjustment programme assumed.
That makes deficit cuts harder to find and more likely to be counterproductive.
If the Greeks are willing to do the right thing, there is a case for giving them more time to do it.
A request, suggested in the analysis, to stretch the next €11.5bn of austerity over four rather than two years will raise the blood pressure of Greece's eurozone creditors. But it may well raise their chance of being paid back.
And as a Europe-wide slowdown is forcing other states to shift back their fiscal deficit targets, the political space may open to let Greece do the same.
It will be a hard sell.
An extension will leave a bigger deficit to plug for a few years.
The analysis claims that Athens can fund this without a third fiscal rescue package.
It points to International Monetary Fund money allocated to a possible programme extension; the ability to roll over short-term debt – financed by central bank money through Greek banks – if its partners do not force it to pay it off; and the possibility of paying back the first rescue later than planned.
If the numbers add up, such measures would help.
So would letting the eurozone rescue fund bail out Greek banks directly, as it may do with Spain's.
But if Athens' new ideas make economic sense, they are political non-starters until Europe can trust that Greece's leaders, after disappointing for so long, finally mean business.
