China has reiterated its commitment to a peaceful solution in the long-running dispute with Japan over the Senkaku islands in the East China Sea.
Yet as anti-Japanese protests continue to spread across the country, hopes that the tensins can be contained by diplomatic means are looking dangerously uncertain.
The protests have been sparked by Japan's decision to buy the islands from their private owner.
This may have seemed like provocation.
But the real provocateur is Shintaro Ishihara, Tokyo's governor, a well-known China baiter, who in April decided to buy them through public subscription.
In pre-empting his purchase, Japan has kept sovereignty in the government's, not populists', hands.
Yet China's authorities appear to have done little to rein in growing popular anger.
Protests have been gathering in intensity over recent days, targeting and even attacking Japanese interests and businesses.
Yesterday's demonstrations to mark the 81st anniversary of Japan's invasion of China were the biggest expression of anti-Japanese feeling in decades.
Though authorities called on protesters to behave in an “orderly, lawful . . . fashion”, they have fanned the flames by legitimising the protests.
State media has reported that hundreds of Chinese fishing boats are heading for the islands to stage a mass protest, where they may clash with Japanese authorities.
The fact that Beijing has not stopped the flotilla would suggest that, at the very least, there is tacit approval of such muscle-flexing.
If true, this is a dangerous tactic.
The risk that this could spark a disastrous train of events – either through a showdown between Japan's Coast Guard and the boats or the accidental death of a Japanese national – is significant.
Washington has already indicated that, though it will not take sides in the ownership dispute, the Senkaku islands are covered by its security treaty with Japan.
This means in theory that should the dispute escalate into outright conflict, US forces would defend the islands against Chinese attack.
The protests come at a difficult time in China, as it prepares for a delicate leadership transition that has been marked by scandals over corruption.
The economy, accustomed to dynamic growth, is also slowing, bringing new pressures for a new generation.
In the past China's communist leadership has not hesitated to whip up nationalist sentiment – in particular against Japan – in bid to restore faith in the party.
This has had pernicious effects, not least in the anti-Japanese mood now taking hold across China.
Japan has long been a tool in the party's political armoury.
But the scale of protests shows that such jingoism can rapidly spiral out of control.
Already the economic consequences are being felt as factories and businesses shut down for fear of retaliation.
Chinese jobs will be at stake.
The next few days will be critical to finding the peaceful solution that China says it wants.
In the meantime, both sides must show restraint in responding to popular unrest.
