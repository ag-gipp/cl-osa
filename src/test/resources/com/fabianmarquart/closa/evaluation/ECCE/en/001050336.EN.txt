The selection of Roberto Azevêdo as the new head of the World Trade Organisation is undoubtably a diplomatic coup for Brazil.
Under the presidency of Dilma Rousseff, the Latin American giant is continuing to try and build a reputation as the world's mediator-in-chief, placing its candidates at the top of multilateral bodies.
Mr Azevêdo's choice follows the appointment of José Graziano da Silva as director-general of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation in 2010.
A harder question is whether Mr Azevêdo's selection can revive the fortunes of an organisation that is struggling to retain its influence.
The WTO continues to have a trusted role in monitoring trade agreements and umpiring disputes. But deep disagreements among key trading nations have meant the Geneva-based body has been unable to broker multilateral deals.
The Doha round, which began in 2001, is dead in all but name.
The WTO is absent just when the global economy needs firm stewardship.
World trade grew by just 2 per cent in 2012, the second-worst performance since records began in 1981, and less than global economic growth.
As Pascal Lamy, the current WTO chief, warned last month, the threat of protectionism is rising.
Ever more economies are turning to bilateral trade deals, a second-best solution since they involve trade displacement from third parties.
At first sight, the instalment of a Brazilian at the helm of the WTO does not look promising.
Brazil – of which Mr Azevêdo has been WTO ambassador since 2008 – is hardly a champion of free-trade.
Mercosur, the regional Latin American trade pact Brazil helped to create in 1991, has failed to deliver.
In 2011, Brazil sought the WTO's approval to retaliate against those countries engaging in ultra-loose monetary policies – a protectionist step.
Mr Azevêdo needs to prove he is his own man.
His experience as a diplomat and WTO insider could prove handy for reviving the fortunes of multilateral talks.
The strong backing he enjoys among the representatives of the developing world – who above all contributed to his selection – makes him well-suited to bridge the many north-south divisions that have prevented multilateral deals.
These include the controversy over agricultural subsidies in mature economies, one of the sticking points of the Doha round.
The Brazilian diplomat needs to be pragmatic and to avoid seeking the grand bargains that have so far proven elusive.
It is better to start with less-ambitious packages, such as measures on trade facilitation, which are easier to agree upon.
He may also have to have an open mind about bilateral trade talks, such as the recently launched EU-US negotiations.
These can be useful platforms on which to build multilateral deals.
Mr Azevêdo's first test will be the WTO conference scheduled for December in Bali.
An agreement on the meeting's limited agenda would be a stepping stone for larger multilateral deals.
Failure would cast a long shadow over the future of the WTO as a dealmaker.
