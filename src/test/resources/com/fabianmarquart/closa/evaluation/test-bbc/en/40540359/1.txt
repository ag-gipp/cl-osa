G20 Hamburg: Leaders fail to bridge Trump climate chasm

Leaders of 19 nations at the G20 summit in Germany have renewed their pledge to implement the Paris deal on climate change, despite the US pulling out.
Deadlock over the issue had held up the last day of talks in Hamburg but a final agreement was eventually reached.
It acknowledges President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement without undermining the commitment of other countries.
The compromise comes after violent protests in the host city.
The joint summit statement released on Saturday said: "We take note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris Agreement."
However, the leaders of the other G20 members agreed the accord committing nations to restrict global temperature increases was "irreversible".
In her closing news conference, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she still deplored Mr Trump's position on the Paris accord but she was "gratified" the other 19 nations opposed its renegotiation.

The statement also said the US would "endeavour to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently".
Mr Trump has pledged to help the US coal industry make a comeback and has previously characterised the Paris agreement as trying to disadvantage American workers.
He won another concession on a second sticking point - trade. While renewing a pledge against protectionism, the communiqu√© for the first time underlined the right of countries to protect their markets.
Mr Trump cancelled his own scheduled news conference on Saturday, reinforcing the image of the G20 as the G19 + 1, reports the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins.
It has been a divisive summit in which the rest of the world has been struggling to come to terms with the US president's "America first" policy, our correspondent says.
