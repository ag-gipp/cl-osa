London attack: The victims

Details have emerged of the eight people killed in the London Bridge terror attack.
Three men drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before getting out and stabbing people in nearby Borough Market on Saturday.
Ignacio Echeverria Miralles De Imperial, 39, died trying to defend a woman who was being stabbed by the attackers.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has praised his "heroic and exemplary act".
Mr Echeverria's sister, Isabel, went on social media to pay tribute to her brother and said he would never be forgotten.
"My brother Ignacio tried to stop the terrorists and lost his life trying to save others," she said.
Mr Echeverria, from Madrid was working for HSBC bank in London.
He saw the attack unfolding as he cycled back from a park with two friends he had been skateboarding with.
He used his skateboard against one of the attackers who was stabbing a woman, Spanish media has reported.
Mr Rajoy has requested that Mr Echeverria be granted an award - the Silver Cross of the Order of Civil Merit.
Police searching for Frenchman Xavier Thomas discovered a body in the River Thames on Tuesday evening.
At the time of the attack, Mr Thomas was walking along the bridge with his girlfriend, Christine Delcros, who was seriously injured.
It is thought the 45-year-old was thrown off London Bridge into the water after being hit by the white van driven by the three attackers.
Mr Thomas, one of three French victims killed in the attack, was visiting the capital from his home in France.
His partner said he was "an exceptional man" who "did everything for his children".
Ms Delcros said: "I wish, during these difficult times, to pay tribute to the exceptional man you were and will still remain for us all."
French chef Sebastien Belanger, who worked at the Coq d'Argent near Bank, was also killed in the attack.
The 36-year-old had been watching the Champions League final with friends at a nearby pub.
His girlfriend's sister, Greta Tubutyte, told the Evening Standard they left the pub just before the attack.
"When the van hit they thought it was just a car accident. Then after a few seconds they saw people running, screaming, and a guy with a knife attacking," she said.
"He stabbed a woman just in front of them. One of Sebastien's friends got all the blood on him and they panicked and screamed 'run'."
Australian Sara Zelenak, from Brisbane, was working as an au pair in London, looking after two young boys.
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said she was seen fleeing from the knifemen during the attack.
The 21-year-old's parents said they were "deeply saddened at the tragic loss of our beautiful daughter".
Her aunt described her niece as "the girl next door, very special and a kindred spirit".
Sara had reportedly been due to babysit on Saturday night, but the child's grandmother stepped in, which meant she could go out with friends.
She is one of two Australian nationals killed in the atrocity.
The family of Australian Kirsty Boden said she died after running towards the danger to help victims on London Bridge.
The 28-year-old was from Loxton in South Australia and had been working in the UK as a senior staff nurse in Theatres Recovery.
In a statement, her family said: "Kirsty was loved and adored by her family, friends and boyfriend.
"She was the most outgoing, kind and generous person who loved to help people.
"Helping people was what she loved to do in her job as a nurse and in her daily life.
"We are so proud of Kirsty's brave actions which demonstrate how selfless, caring and heroic she was, not only on that night, but throughout all of her life.
"Kirsty - we love you and we will miss you dearly."
Dame Eileen Sills, chief nurse at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, said colleagues described Kirsty as "one in a million who always went the extra mile for the patients in her care".
Niall Dickson, CEO of the NHS Confederation, added: "Her courage and selflessness reflect all that is best about the NHS and will not be forgotten."
Canadian Chrissy Archibald died in the arms of her fiancé, Tyler Ferguson, on London Bridge.
Ms Archibald, who was originally from British Columbia, worked in a homeless shelter until she moved to Europe.
"She had room in her heart for everyone and believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected," a family statement said.
"She would have had no understanding of the callous cruelty that caused her death.
"Please honour her by making your community a better place. Volunteer your time and labour or donate to a homeless shelter. Tell them Chrissy sent you."
Her fiancé's sister, Cassie, wrote on Facebook: "Hearing his painful sobs on the phone while he's alone trying to deal with this tears me apart."
Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was "heartbroken" that a Canadian national had been among those killed.
James McMullan, 32, from Hackney, London, was last seen outside the Barrowboy And Banker pub in London Bridge on Saturday night.
His sister, Melissa, told the BBC: "While our pain will never diminish, it is important for us to all carry on with our lives in direct opposition to those who are trying to destroy us and remember that hatred is the refuge of small-minded individuals and will only breed more.
"This is not a course we will follow despite our loss.
"From his friends that were with him that night, they want everyone to know what a generous and caring friend he was."
French national Alexandre Pigeard, 26, was stabbed while working on the terrace of a restaurant in Borough Market - where he had been employed for nine months.
In a statement, his family said: "Alexandre was a marvellous son, a perfect older brother and a radiant young man much loved by all who had the good fortune to meet him.
"All his friends praised his kindness, his good humour and his generosity."
They said he was passionate about electronic music and a member of "Club 808", a group of DJs based in Caen (Calvados).
Manager of the Boro Bistro restaurant, Vincent Le Berre, told the Brittany news outlet Le Telegramme how his colleague, Mr Pigeard, was "hit in the neck with a knife" by one of the attackers.
"I managed to escape him, but my friend Alexandre did not have that chance," he said.
According to French media, Mr Pigeard was from Caen, in Normandy, but had been living in London for more than two years.
