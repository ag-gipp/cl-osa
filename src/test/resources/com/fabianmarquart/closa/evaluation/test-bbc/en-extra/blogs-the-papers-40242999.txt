The surprise return to cabinet of Michael Gove as the new environment secretary features on a number of Monday's front pages.
He is the star of the Daily Telegraph's splash, which sees his unexpected comeback as Theresa May's attempt to avoid a leadership challenge.
The newspaper thinks the prime minister is addressing complaints that she is too autocratic and unwilling to work with her critics.
It also expects Mr Gove to become a key adviser on Brexit and a powerful ally in getting any deal through the Commons.
The Sun says he is the biggest winner in the "post-election disaster shake-up".
The Times interprets the limited reshuffle as a signal that Mrs May will go for a so-called soft Brexit.
The newspaper says she faces overwhelming pressure to go for looser controls on immigration, a rethink on leaving the customs union, and a more flexible approach to the European Court of Justice.
It also points out that Damian Green, who has been promoted to Mrs May's deputy in all but name, is an ardent Remain campaigner.

The prime minister is shown arriving at her local church with her husband on the front of the Guardian, which says her future is hanging in the balance.
"You're gonna need a prayer" is the Sun's caption on a photo of her speaking to the priest.
The Guardian reports that Mrs May will appeal to her party's 1922 committee for support at their "crunch meeting" later.
One unnamed Conservative tells the paper that she will need a "barnstorming" performance to hold on to her job.
According to the Daily Mail, the PM has "torn up" the controversial Tory manifesto as the price for cabinet support for her leadership.
The newspaper predicts that plans to water down guarantees on pension increases, means-test winter fuel payments and repeal the fox-hunting ban will be ditched in a slimmed down Queen's Speech next week.
Mrs May's dream of creating a new generation of grammar schools will also be shelved, it reports.
The Daily Express and the Sun both focus on Boris Johnson's declaration of loyalty to Mrs May and his attempt to rally support for the prime minister - or, as the Sun's headline puts it: "Bojo - binning May is a no-no."
The Daily Mirror has a beaming Jeremy Corbyn on its front page, alongside the headline: "I can be prime minister in months."
It says the Labour leader expects to win if there is a second snap general election.
The Guardian reports that Donald Trump's state visit to Britain is "on hold" after he told Mrs May that he didn't want to face large public protests.
The report is sourced to an unnamed Downing Street adviser, who was said to have been in the room when the phone call was made in recent weeks.
It has been denied by the White House and No 10, but the Times says the state visit won't be mentioned in the Queen's Speech - a tacit acknowledgement that it is now "on ice".
Google's artificial intelligence creation, Deep Mind, has beaten board game champions, mastered poker and taught itself to get around the London Underground. But it appears now to have met its match in Homer Simpson.
The Times reports that while Deep Mind can accurately recognise objects in photographs, it struggles when confronted with videos of activities such as slapping, falling on one's face or eating donuts - a particular passion of Homer's.
It is sometimes said, the Times notes, that the main thing holding back artificial intelligence is human stupidity.
