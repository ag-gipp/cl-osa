Shoreham boat collision: One dead and two people missing

One man has died and another two are believed missing after a boat sank off the West Sussex coast.
A fourth man, a 45-year-old from London, was rescued at about 05:50 BST after the vessel went down two miles off the coast of Shoreham, the RNLI said.
A search is currently being carried out between Worthing Pier in the west and Brighton in the east.
The rescued man was found clinging to a buoy and saved by a passing fisherman.
The man's body was recovered from the sea at about 08:15 and brought ashore by a coastguard helicopter.
Sussex Police said they believed the four men left Brighton Marina at about midnight and the boat may have sunk "a couple of hours later, but the facts are not clear at this time".
The rescued man was picked up by an RNLI lifeboat and taken to shore at Shoreham before being taken to hospital.
BBC South East reporter Simon Jones said it was thought he had been in the water for several hours.
The Marine Accident Investigation Branch is examining what happened.
