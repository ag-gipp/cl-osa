One report, two very different front pages.
On Thursday, the health watchdog NICE published draft guidance for councils on reducing air pollution in England.
The guidance warns that vehicles accelerating or decelerating too quickly can "increase harmful emissions".
That causes the Telegraph to lead with: "Axe speed bumps to save lives".
"Where a 20mph limit is appropriate, humps and bumps aren't the most efficient way of doing it," Ralph Bagge, deputy chairman of the NICE guideline committee, tells the paper.
"People tend to accelerate up to 30mph, hit the brakes and do about 15mph over the hump, and then accelerate again.
"In emissions terms that's a very ineffective deterrent."
The Daily Mail takes the same NICE report and calls it a "crackdown on the motorist".
"Officials want more speed cameras and variable limits to encourage smoother, more fuel efficient driving," the paper says.
The Mail's editorial is less than impressed.
"When health watchdog NICE was set up in 1999, its chief purpose was to decide which drugs should be available on the NHS," it says.
"But look at it now...is there any area of life on which Nanny Nice feels unqualified to rule?
"This is the story of all quangos: give them an ounce of authority, and before you know it they'll be trying to take over the world."
David Eatock, who played for Newcastle United in the 1990s, becomes the latest footballer to talk about suffering sexual abuse.
He was assaulted by George Ormond, a former coach who was jailed for six years in 2002.
Eatock tells the Guardian the abuse started after moving from Chorley in Lancashire to Newcastle aged 18.
"I can still remember the look on his [Ormond's] face, how terrifying it was, and how his eyes were possessed," Eatock says.
"I'd only just met him but when we got back to the hotel he followed me back to my room.
"Then the door closed and he was in there with me."
Eatock never played for Newcastle's first team and is now a personal trainer.
"For the last 10 years I've suffered from anxiety," he says. "I've had two mental breakdowns where I've been agoraphobic for six months."
Eatock has given a statement to the police, having never done so before.
Newcastle United say they "will co-operate fully with the police and relevant authorities and provide every assistance".
Meanwhile, Karen Danczuk - the former wife of Labour MP Simon Danczuk - tells the Sun she was raped by her brother as a child.
On Wednesday, Michael Burke, 38, was found guilty of eight rapes on three victims.
"He robbed me of my childhood," she says. "I was so damaged."
In June, the Financial Times argued for Britain to remain inside the European Union, saying it was "no time to revert to Little England".
Today, it reports that London is "still luring European expats - despite the EU vote".
"Ever since Britain's surprise vote, London has been clouded by worry that its best days are behind it as the talent and wealth that gathered during the past 30 years migrates to other global cities where life is less uncertain.
"That may yet come to pass. But for the time being, there are few obvious signs of the exodus and London is still kicking."
There are few "signs of the exodus" on the front page of the Guardian, either.
It reports a "huge demand" from EU citizens to stay in the UK before Brexit begins.
One "stampede" that is happening, reports the Times, is to the Irish passport office.
"Applications for Irish passports have reached a record high with a surge in demand from people in Britain," the paper says.
"Irish passports will be valuable travel documents after Britain leaves the EU as they will allow the holder to continue to move and work freely within the bloc."
The inventor of the Big Mac died on Monday, aged 98.
Michael "Jim" Delligatti came up with the idea almost 50 years ago.
The Sun's headline is: "Big Mac and dies."
The front page of the Times reports that a school in Mansfield has banned pupils from putting their hands up to answer questions.
The school says it wants to stop "the same hands going up" - but the Times interprets it as: "School warns pupils who try too hard."
A number of other papers also cover the story.
One mother tells the Daily Mail that she's in favour. "The kids soon get used to it, and it's to give them all a chance," she says.
But Chris McGovern from the Campaign for Real Education is less keen.
"Politically correct nonsense," he says.
