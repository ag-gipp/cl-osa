Discussion VTE is far less common in children than in adults and often is associated with underlying medical conditions such as malignancy, autoimmune disease, and congenital heart disease or is caused by medical interventions such as central venous lines. Keeping in mind that not all children with these risk factors will develop VTE, it is apparent that genetic risk factors play an important role in which children will develop thrombosis.33–101,115,116 Apart from a recent systematic review of the role of thrombophilia in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and ischemic stroke,117,118 to the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of observational studies investigating the association of genetic traits and VTE in children. Each of the traits investigated shows a significant association with first onset of pediatric VTE, with the highest ORs found for combined genetic traits and deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S. Our findings are concordant with adult studies demonstrating that inherited deficiencies of the natural anticoagulants protein C, protein S, and antithrombin are present in <10% of patients with VTE but that patients with these deficiency states are considered at higher risk for a first VTE onset.119 In the white adult population, the factor V mutation increases the risk of a first episode of VTE by 3- to 7-fold, whereas the factor II variant increases the risk by 2- to 3-fold.120,121 In addition, it has been demonstrated in a recent meta-analysis that elevated lipoprotein( a) increases the risk of a first symptomatic VTE in adults nearly 2-fold.29 A history of thrombosis is a predictor for VTE recurrence in adults in 3% to 13% of consecutive patients after 1 year and in 12% to 28% after 5 years.119 In pediatric cohorts, the proportion of children developing recurrent VTE ranged from 3% in neonates to 8% in older children2,12–14 and as high as 21% in children reported with a first idiopathic VTE.63 The results of this meta-analysis show that 11.4% of children with nonidiopathic thrombosis overall (ie, regardless of IT status) developed a second VTE, which is consistent with the rate reported in large pediatric cohort studies not systematically investigating genetic traits.2,12,14,79 Second events, however, were observed mainly in adolescents and occurred in &approx;80% of affected children after withdrawal of anticoagulant therapy. In the present meta-analysis, a significant association with recurrent VTE in children was found for protein C, protein S, and antithrombin deficiency; the factor II variant; and ≥2 genetic traits.
