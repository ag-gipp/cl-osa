The growth of electronic commerce has been linked closely with the development and diffusion of new information technologies and of telecommunications infrastructure. [...] Telecommunications infrastructure has developed considerably over the past few decades, and now involves either fixed-line or radiobased networks which can both be used for electronic commerce. [...] The Internet is particularly important in establishing links between existing forms of electronic commerce. This is the reason why most studies on the development of electronic commerce focus on the growth of the Internet or on what is sometimes called the “GII”, the Global Information Infrastructure.
