Infectious diseases AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which can be transmitted in three ways: sexual transmission; transfusing infected blood or blood products or using nonsterile injection equipment; or from mother to child. The incubation period between initial HIV infection and developing AIDS is about 10 years or more. The number of notified cases of AIDS is rising in central and eastern Europe, although more people have been diagnosed with AIDS in western and northern Europe. Hungary has one of the highest incidence rates for AIDS among the reference countries (0.3 per 100 000 population in 1998), but this is still much lower than the EU average (3.3 per 100 000) (Fig. 26). The largest transmission groups in Hungary are homo- and bisexual contacts (72%), heterosexual contacts (12%) and blood products (8%). There is some transmission from mother to child (3%), but very few cases of transmission from injected drugs (0.3%) have been reported (European Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS, 1998). [Seite 18] The incidence of tuberculosis decreased until 1990 but has increased since then. The incidence in the 1990s was somewhat higher than the average for the reference countries but more than twice the EU average. The incidence rate for syphilis has been among the lowest in the reference countries since the early 1980s. The decrease has continued, whereas several reference countries have reported major epidemics of syphilis in the 1990s (Fig. 27). The incidence of gonococcal infections has declined from relatively high levels in the early 1980s in accordance with the trends for other reference countries. Hungary had a relatively high incidence of mumps in the early 1990s, but since the introduction of compulsory vaccination in 1991 this has decreased since 1993 to one of the lowest among the reference countries. The incidence rates of viral hepatitis, diphtheria, measles, pertussis and malaria are all among the lowest rates in the reference countries.
