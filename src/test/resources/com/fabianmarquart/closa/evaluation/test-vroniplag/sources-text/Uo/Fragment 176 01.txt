[Seite 189] Hunger was one of the crucial experiences of the War. The supply of food in the German Reich was disastrous. Britain cut off the German harbours from international trade with an offensive blockade. The North Sea was mined and declared a no-go area. The laws of the countries involved in the War prohibited ‘trading with the enemy’. Since the mid-19th century, the food supply had depended on imports and therefore became increasingly difficult. In Germany, the blockade policy of the allied forces was criticized as an inhuman strategy of warfare. In late October 1915, two meat-free days per week were introduced for the whole German Reich. In the famous Steckrübenwinter of 1916-191717 [sic], the situation grew especially severe. Bread, marmelade, soup, everything was made of turnips. Class differences, political unrest and interior conflict escalated during the War.3 [Anm.: Satz bei Uo ausgelassen] There were food riots and demonstrations. People called for a Lebensmitteldiktator (‘food dictator’) for the organization of fair distribution. For the first time in German history, a centralized state system of supply was established. On 22 May 1916, the Kriegsernährungsamt (KEA) (‘War Office of Food Supply’) was founded to coordinate the efforts of the Reichsgetreidestelle, Reichsfleischstelle, Reichszuckerstelle, Reichskartoffelstelle, and Reichsfettstelle in distributing grain, meat, sugar, potatoes and fat. A complicated system of food ration-cards was introduced. [...]4 [Seite 190] The Schutzzollpolitik (‘policy of protective tariff’) of the Prussian Junkerstaat along with the Dreiklassenwahlrecht (three class electoral system) and the danger of war belonged to the most controversial topics in the pre-war political debate. The agrarian fraction of the political spectrum was opposed to opening the market because cheap foreign imports lowered the prices. The import of meat became a central issue in these controversies. Import bans were debated, but could not be rigorously imposed as the national supply depended on imports. A nationalist rhetoric often served as compensation. However, different interest groups took different attitudes toward the import of foreign goods. [Anm.: Satz bei Uo ausgelassen] The working classes were far less concerned with national feeling. Housewives with a family to feed on their hands were not primarily interested in buying pork from German pigs, but in being able to afford meat at all, no matter whether it came from Russia or America. Even before the First World War, meat was rare and expensive, while being a central and symbolically highly charged component of the diet of the urban working-class family. In October 1912, the Berlin Magistrat tried to relieve the meat shortage by importing cheap meat from Russian Poland. 3 Jürgen Kocka, Klassengesellschaft im Krieg: Deutsche Sozialgeschichte 1914-1918, Frankfurt: Fischer, 1988. 4 The radical changes in consumption during the War are described in detail by Anne Roerkohl, ‘Die Lebensmittelversorgung während des Ersten Weltkrieges im Spannungsfeld kommunaler und staatlicher Maßnahmen’, Hans Jürgen Teuteberg (ed.), Durchbruch zum modernen Massenkonsum: Lebensmittelmärkte und Lebensmittelqualität im Städtewachstum des Industriezeitalters, Münster: F.
