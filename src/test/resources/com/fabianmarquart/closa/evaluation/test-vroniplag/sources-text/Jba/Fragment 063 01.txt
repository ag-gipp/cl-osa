[...] so that they can replace more expensive forms of health care and improve the quality and efficiency of patient care. [...] The hospital system was well developed, but its size and high costs endangered the operation of the entire health care system. Therefore, the radical and coordinated modernization of structure, financing and management within the hospital sector become inevitable. The number of hospital beds in intensive care, in chronic care and in rehabilitation has been considered to be too low. The number of hospital beds per 100 000 population has decreased in almost all reference countries since 1985. The decrease in Hungary (–13%) was smaller than the decrease in the EU in general (–21%), and the rate in Hungary (833 per 100 000 in 1998) remained higher than both the EU average (687 per 100 000 in 1997) and the average for the reference countries (739 per 100 000 in 1998) (Fig. 42).
