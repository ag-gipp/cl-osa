In a related study, Wenneberg, Schneider, Walton, MacClean, Levitsky, Salerno, et al. (1997) examined die cardiovascular effects of TM in 39 normotensive males and an equal number of controls. The investigators reported an average 9 mmHg drop in diastolic blood pressure (p < .04) after four months among those in the TM group. No differences were found in the cardiovascular responses to stressors of the TM group and the control group. Alexander, Robinson, et al. (1994) comprehensively review studies that examine the effects of TM and other methods of relaxation and meditation on cardiovascular risk factors, morbidity, and mortality. There is increasing evidence, then, that psychosocial and spiritual interventions directed at reducing psychological stress, improving health behaviors, and increasing social support benefit prognosis in CAD.
