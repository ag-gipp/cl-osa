It is directly founded upon the European Communities, in particular the European Economic Community, created by the Treaty of Rome 1957. What is distinctive about the Community compared with many international organizations is that broad executive, legislative, and fiscal powers are vested in organs of the Community. Moreover, the European Court of Justice exercises extensive judicial powers in applying and enforcing Community law, Regulations made by the Council of Ministers are directly applicable in all Member States as soon as they have been promulgated by the Council.45 Treaty provisions and other Community measures may have direct effect in Member States, i.e. they may create rights which are directly enforceable by individuals in national courts. As was said by the European Court of Justice in 1963, '... the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law, for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and the subjects of which comprise not only Member States but also their nationals.'46 The Court has often emphasized the importance of Community law being uniformly applicable throughout Member States, without the need to wait for separate legislative action by individual states: 'The law stemming from the treaty, an independent source of law, could not, because of its special and original nature, be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed, without being deprived of its character as Community law and without the legal basis of the Community itself being called into question.47 45 EEC Treaty, Art. 189. 46 Van Gend en Loos v.
