The SDR for ischaemic heart disease among males aged 0–64 years was close to the EU average in 1970 but rose rapidly in the late 1970s, remained relatively constant until 1993 and has declined slightly since then. It has, however, remained above the average for the reference countries during the whole period, and has been one of the highest rates, excluding Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The rate for females has been the highest for most of the period, excluding Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (Fig. 12, 13). [Seite 12] The SDRs for cerebrovascular diseases in the age group 0–64 years have exceeded the averages of the reference countries for males and females since 1970. The rates increased significantly between 1975 and 1980 among both males and females, remained almost constant until 1985 among females and then started to decrease, whereas men remained nearly constant from 1980 to 1993 before declining. The annual rate for both sexes combined was almost four times the EU average from 1996 to 1998 (Fig. 14, 15).
