Finally, it must be noted that these findings are snap-shots, which merely portray the situation of the animals 96 h after induction of trauma. It would therefore be conceivable in progressive studies to also consider examinations at other points in time. Furthermore, it is imaginable to investigate genetically modified mice with the presented polytrauma model.
