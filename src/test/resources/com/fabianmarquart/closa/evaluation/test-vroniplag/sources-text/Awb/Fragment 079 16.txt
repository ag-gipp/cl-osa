The number of attached cross-bridges is related to the extent of postvibration force development (1, 14). Supposing the rigor-hypothesis was true, one would predict that in mitral-valve incompetence the extent of force recovery after induction of vibration should be reduced as compared with other types of mitral-valve disease: an increased number of rigor bridges, that can not reattach after cessation of vibration, has to result in a reduced extent of active force development following cessation of vibration. However, the extent of force-recovery after induction of vibration was the same in any type of mitral valve disease (Table 1), Thus the fraction of cross-bridges unable to reattach after cessation of vibration ("rigor bridges") was not related to the type of mitral-valve disease. Furthermore, the rigor state requires that the level of ATP falls below a critical limit. However this is unlikely as the ATP concentration is held constant in a skinned fibre experimental environment. Thus presence of "rigor-bridges" can not explain the different shortening behaviour in various types of mitral-valve disease. [ [EN 1] Bauernschmitt, R., C. F, Vahl, R. Lange, and S.
