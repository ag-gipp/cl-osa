As a consequence of all this, the American awareness of the community of destinies within the Western or Atlantic world has become more and more distinct.1 It stands behind the works of such scholars of "Atlantic history", as Preserved Smith, Carl Becker, Louis Gottschalk and Crane Brinton. [...] The extent of the refugee scholars' influence upon the development of the study of European history in the United States is still very difficult to characterize and to evaluate. [FN] 1 Krieger, loc. cit. pp. 288 ff. [S. 75] It became impressively manifest when, in December 1966, Hajo Holborn, the great German-born teacher of the history of Germany at Yale, was elected president of the American Historical Association.1 [FN] 1 On the influence exerted by refugee scholars, notably from Germany and Austria cf. Gerald Stourzh, "Die deutschsprachige Emigration in den Vereinigten Staaten: Geschichtswissenschaft und politische Wissenschaft", Jahrbuch f√ºr Amerikastudien 10 (1965), pp. 59-77, 232-66; 11 (1966), pp. 260-317.
