[Seite 255, li. Sp., Z. 1-13] 4) Activation- and relaxation-solutions After mounting the muscle preparations isometrically between vibrator and force transducer the fibres were activated or relaxed by respective solutions of the following composition: relaxation solution: 10 mmol/L ATP, 12.5 mmol/L MgC12, 5 mmol/L EGTA, 20mmol/L imidazol, 5 mmol/L NaN<sub>3</sub>, 10 mmol/L phosphocreatine and 400 U/ml CPK. In the contraction solution EGTA was substituted by CaEGTA. [...] The negative logarithm of the free Calcium concentration (pCa) of the standard relaxation- and contraction solution was 8.0 and 4.3. The free Calcium concentration was calculated according to Fabiato and Fabiato (7). [Seite 259, re. Sp., Z. 32-35] [EN 7] Fabiato A., and F.
