[Seite 1, Fn. 1] 1 The following ten candidate countries for accession to the European Union were used as reference countries: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. [Seite 5, Zeile 8 ff.] The countries of the EU have generally reached an advanced stage of demographic transition, with the younger age groups becoming smaller in relation to the middle and, at times, older age groups. The reference countries are, in general, developing a similar population structure. In Hungary the age groups 0–19 years (especially 10–14 years) and 30–39 years were proportionally smaller in 1998 than in the reference countries on average. The older cohorts (age groups 50–59 years and 65 years or more) were larger. The natural growth rate has been below the EU average since 1979, and Hungary was the first of the reference countries to have a negative rate (since 1981). In 1998 the Hungarian natural growth rate (–4.3 per 1000 population) was one of the lowest among the reference countries, well below the average for the reference countries (–1.4 per 1000) and the EU average (+0.8 per 1000) (Fig. 2). The crude birth rate has equalled the average for the reference countries, so the low natural growth has been caused by the high crude death rate. Mortality has constantly been the highest among the reference countries. The fertility rate has fallen under the replacement level in Hungary (1.3 in 1998), similar to the other reference countries (range from 1.1 to 1.5).
