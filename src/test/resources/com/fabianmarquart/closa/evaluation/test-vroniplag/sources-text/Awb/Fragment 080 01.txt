[Seite 258, li. Sp., Z. 23-38] "Down’regulation of cross-bridge cycling”? In contrast to the "rigor theory" that introduced a 2-state model with cross bridges, either cycling or non-cycling, the cross-bridge-cycling rate may be gradually regulated. This may result either in several populations of cross-bridges each with a characteristic cycling rate or in gradually reduced cycling of cross-bridges (18, 19). According to this concept in MVI the average velocity of cross-bridge cycling may be reduced (down-regulated). This would explain the reduction of Vmax in MVI. However, then the time constants of isometric force development should be altered as well as observed after down-regulation of cross-bridges in tracheal muscle (19). As extent and time constant of force recovery were the same in any type of mitral-valve disease (Table 1) a down regulation of cross-bridge-cycling rate is unlikely to explain the different shortening velocities.
