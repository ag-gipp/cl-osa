Main causes of death Comparing the death rates from main causes between countries can indicate how far the observed mortality might be reduced. As almost all the causes underlying the deaths attributed to cardiovascular diseases, cancer and accidents are influenced by collective and individual habits and behaviour, a wide variety of health promotion and prevention measures can bring about changes to reduce health risks and thus disease and premature deaths. Mortality in Hungary for the age group 35–64 is particularly high relative to the reference countries and the EU, with mortality due to cancers and cardiovascular disease contributing a high proportion of this excess (Fig. 7). In addition, the SDR for diseases of the digestive system is also especially high in the age group 35–64 years. Cardiovascular diseases The SDRs for cardiovascular diseases among males aged 0–64 years were close to the EU average for most reference countries in 1970. Since then, the SDRs for males have increased in nearly all reference countries, including Hungary, whereas they have declined in the EU. In the 1970s and 1980s, Hungary’s SDR was the highest among the reference countries; although it decreased in the 1990s, especially after 1993, it was still higher than the average for the reference countries and three times the EU average in 1998 (Fig. 8, 9). The SDR for cardiovascular diseases among females aged 0–64 years was the highest among the reference countries from 1970 to the 1990s (along with Romania) and showed little sign of decline. Mortality started to decrease in the early 1990s, as in most of the reference countries. In 1998, however, the SDR was still one of the highest among the reference countries and, similar to males, three times the EU average (Fig. 10, 11).
