A central role in SMC proliferation is attributable to mitogenic factors as well as to factors governing the cell cycle. The master check point in cell cycling is the restriction check point at the G1 phase at which cells are committed to enter S phase. The ultimate substrate in this pathway comprising key regulators such as cyclins and [Seite 681] cyclin dependent kinases are the proteins of the pRb family, namely pRb itself, p130 and p107 [7,15-18]. All of these factors have to be activated and inactivated in a cell cycle dependent fashion to enable the cells to progress through the cell cycle and finally perform cell division and proliferation.
