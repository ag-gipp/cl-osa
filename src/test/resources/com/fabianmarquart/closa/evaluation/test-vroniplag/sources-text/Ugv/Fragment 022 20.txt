[Seite 166] CRP was chosen for this study as a possible marker of response to therapy because of [its short half-life, six to eight hours, which allows the rapid detection of changes in inflammation,3] an excellent correlation with the presence of inflammatory conditions of the female pelvis7 [and the detection of direct quantitative relationships with the severity of inflammation from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).4] Angerman et al5 were able to correlate quantitative CRP determinations with the clinical course of PID more closely than they were the WBC count or ESR.
