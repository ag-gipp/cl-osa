Let $ L $ be the set of sentences of classical first-order logic, and let $ D = \phi(L) $ be the set of $ L $ databases, i.e. the set of sets of $ L $-formulae. The internal state of an agent is then an element of $ D $. [...] An agent's decision-making process is modelled through a set of deduction rules, p. These are simply rules of inference for the logic. We write $ \Delta \vdash_\rho \phi $ if the formula $ \phi $ can be proved from the database $ \Delta $ using only the deduction rules $ \rho $. An agent's [Seite 50] perception function see remains unchanged: $ see : S \rightarrow Per $ . Similarly, our next function has the form $ next : D \times Per \rightarrow D $ . It thus maps a database and a percept to a new database. However, an agent's action selection function, which has the signature $ action : D \rightarrow Ac $, is defined in terms of its deduction rules. The pseudo-code definition of the definition is given in Figure 3.2.
