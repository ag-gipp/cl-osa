Purely reactive agents [...] They base their decision making entirely on the present, with no reference at all to the past. We will call such agents purely reactive, since they simply respond directly to their environment. [...] Formally, the behaviour of a purely reactive agent can be represented by a function $ \mathcal{}AgÂ : E \rightarrow Ac $. It should be easy to see that for every purely reactive agent, there is an equivalent 'standard' agent, as discussed above; the reverse, however, is not generally the case.
