International comparisons of health care expenditure are extremely difficult because the definitions underlying health statistics as well as accounting practices vary from one country to another. The following data on health care expenditure should therefore be used with caution, as the boundaries of what constitutes health care can vary substantially between countries. In 1997, health expenditure as a proportion of GDP for Hungary was 6.5%, above the average for the reference countries (5.1%) but below the EU average of 8.5% (Fig. 41). Data on health care expenditure adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) are only available for four of the reference countries. According to these data, the health expenditure in PPP per person was highest in the Czech Republic (US $904 in 1996), Slovenia (US $743 in 1994), while Hungary (US $602 in 1996) and Poland (US $371 in 1996) had much lower expenditure. Primary health care The practical transformation of the health care delivery system started when a system of family practitioners was established in the early 1990s. This was done to deliver continuous, personal and comprehensive health care, with greater emphasis on prevention, close to where people live. Previously, the family physicians were public sector employees with an obligation to provide primary care to the inhabitants of the area assigned to them.
