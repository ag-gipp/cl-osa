A comparison between countries of death rates related to these causes can indicate how far the observed mortality might be reduced. As almost all causes underlying these deaths are influenced by collective and individual behaviour, a wide variety of health promotion and prevention measures can be applied to bring about changes that will reduce health risks and thus diseases and premature deaths. [...] At 1-14 years, SDRs for the main causes of death external causes (accidents), diseases of the nervous and sensory system and can- [Seite 14] cers are around the EU average. The male death rate for congenital anomalies is also about average, but the female rate is among the highest in the EU countries. At 15-34 years, the male SDR for all causes of death is two and a half times higher than the female SDR. This is mainly due to mortality from external causes, which is slightly below the EU average for men and at this average for women. At 35-64 years, overall mortality among men is still more than twice as high as among women. For both sexes, the death rates for CVDs are above the EU averages for the respective age and sex groups, and both have among the highest SDRs for diseases of the digestive system. Mortality from cancer and external causes is around the EU average for both sexes.
