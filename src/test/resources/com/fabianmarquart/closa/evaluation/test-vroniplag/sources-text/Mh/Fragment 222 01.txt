2.5 The Santa Fe artificial stock market The Santa Fe Stock Market is one of the most adventuresome artificial market projects. It is outlined in detail in Arthur, Holland, LeBaron, Palmer & Tayler (1997), and LeBaron, Arthur & Palmer (forthcoming 1998). [...] The market setup is simple and again borrows much from existing work such as Bray (1982), and Grossman & Stiglitz (1980). In this framework, one period, myopic, constant absolute risk aversion utility, CARA, agents must decide on their desired asset composition between a risk free bond, and a risky stock paying a stochastic dividend. The bond is in infinite supply and pays a constant interest rate, r. The dividend follows a well defined stochastic process $ d_t = \bar{d} + \rho(d_{t-1} - \bar{d} + \epsilon_t) $, where $ \epsilon_t $ is gaussian, independent, and identically distributed, and $ \rho = 0,95 $ for all experiments. It is well known that under CARA utility, and gaussian distributions for dividends and prices, the demand for holding shares of the risky asset by agent i, is given by, $ s_{t,i} = \frac{E_{t,i}(p_{t+1} + d_{t+1})- p_t(1+r)}{\gamma\sigma^2_{t,i,p+d}}, $ where $ p_t $ is the price of the risky asset at t, $ \sigma^2_{t,i,p+d} $ is the conditional variance of p + d at time t, for agent i, $ \gamma $ is the coefficient of absolute risk aversion, and $ E_{t,i} $ is the expectation for agent i at time t. [FN 12] Assuming a fixed number of agents, N , and a number of shares equal to the number of agents gives, $ N = \sum\limits_{i=1}^N s_i $ which closes the model. In this market there is a well defined linear homogeneous rational expectations equilibrium (REE) in which all traders agree on the model for forecasting future dividends, and the relation between prices and the dividend fundamental. An example of this would be $ p_t = b + ad_t $. The parameters a and b can be easily derived from the underlying parameters of the model by simply substituting the pricing function back into the demand function, and setting it equal to 1, which is an identity and must hold for all dt . [FN 12] $ E_{t,i} $ is not the true expectation of agent i at time t. [...]
