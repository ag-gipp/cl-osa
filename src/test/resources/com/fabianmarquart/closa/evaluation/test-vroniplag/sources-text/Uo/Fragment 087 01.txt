[Seite 26] In the beginning many production companies disappeared after one or two films. Later, firms of a more stable character like Sila, Kosmos and Sfinks remained on the market. Sila and Kosmos mainly produced Jewish films with titles in Jiddish. Warsaw, with a population of more than three hundred thousand Jews, was the world centre of Jewish production. In 1913, six out of ten fiction films made for Polish cinemas were Jewish pictures produced by Kosmofilm.18 Similarly to Polish films, they were based on dramas by Jewish playwrights, the best known of them being Jacob Gordin. These Jewish films are a special case in world production. The people living in diaspora, without their own home country, created screen images of clearly national character. While a spectator could not easily distinguish a Danish from a German picture or even from Russian or Czech films of a more cosmopolitan character, the Jewish films were recognizable as Jewish all over the world, always preserving the national customs, tradition and culture. The year 1913 reached its end. The seven months preceding the outbreak of the War still had all the traits of a continuation of the old Europe. In August 1914 one heard the guns. [Seite 27] The three Empires trembled, and when the guns were silenced in 1918, the Empires were no longer on the map. The new world was born, and the new cinema slowly gave notice of its presence. The changes in style, tendencies and general character that were introduced in the years of the military struggle will be studied elsewhere in this volume. 18 Stanislaw Janicki, Polsku filmy fabularne, 1902-1988, Warsaw, 1990, pp. 14-18.
