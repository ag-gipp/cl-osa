[Seite 99] In the following section, we are going to discuss a range of examples in which, similarly to YOU!, war-time film-makers utilised the very transgressiveness of direct address to make a strong appeal to audiences. We will then move on to a discussion of the uses of direct address in factual film-making. Here it is important to note that direct address, while prohibited in fiction films, remained a constitutive stylistic trait of newsreels and documentary shorts.

The majority of factual films contained such casual instances of direct address. In most cases, no particular significance was attached to the staring, waving, posing. Rather, camera awareness in all its forms was woven into the fabric of public life itself, and film-makers simply recorded it in their attempts to capture social reality.
