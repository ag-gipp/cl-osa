Portfolio managers’ expected change of exchange rates (7) then simplifies to $ \Delta s_{t+1}^m = w_t v(\bar{s} - s_t) $ The weight ωt attached to fundamentalists views by portfolio managers evolves according to $ \Delta w_t = \delta(\hat{w}_{t-1}-w_t), 0 \leq \delta\leq 1 $ where $ w_{t-1} $ is defined as the weight, computed ex post, that would have perfectly predicted the realized change in the spot rate, that is, ωt−1 is defined by the equation $ \delta s_t=\hat{w}_{t-1}v(\bar{s}-s_{t-1}) $. Equations (11) and (12) together determine the change of weights that portfolio managers give to fundamentalist’s views: $ \Delta w_t = \delta(\frac{\Delta s_t}{v(\bar{s} - t_{t-1}-w_{t-1})} ), $ where the coefficient $ \delta $ measures the speed of adaption. [...] Frankel and Froot (1990a) take a continuous time limit and obtain differential equations for w(t) and s(t). [...] Simulations of the extended model show that the exchange rate may exhibit a temporary bubble, during which fundamentalists weight is driven to zero, with a rapidly increasing exchange rate, but at some point when the exchange rate has moved too far away from its fundamental value external deficits turn the trend and portfolio managers start giving more weight again to fundamentalists forecast, accelerating the depreciation. Frankel and Froot (1990a, p. 113) note that “Ironically, fundamentalists are initially driven out of the market as the dollar appreciates, even though they are ultimately right about its return to s”.
