[...] but not for women (75.2, 75.1 and 74.2, respectively). There is also marked geographical variation, larger for men (variation from 67.3 years in Western Transdanubia to 65.2 years in Northern Hungary) than for women (variation from 75.4 years in Southern Transdanubia to 74.5 years in the Northern Great Plain) (Hungarian Central Statistical Office, 1998a). Among people over 30 years old, the current probability of dying is higher than in the mid-1960s. The lack of long-term improvement in mortality is particularly pronounced among the middle-aged population. For men aged 35â€“65 years mortality is almost as high now as it was in the early 1920s (Hungarian Central Statistical Office, 1998a).
