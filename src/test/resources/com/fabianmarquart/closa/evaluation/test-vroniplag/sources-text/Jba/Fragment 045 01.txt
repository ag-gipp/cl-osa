Life expectancy Life expectancy at birth was 66.2 years for men and 75.3 years for women in 1998, both well below the average for the reference countries. Except for a brief period between 1984 and 1988, when levels rose almost to the level in 1970, male life expectancy fell between 1970 and 1994. It increased from 1993 to 1997 and declined in 1998. Life expectancy among women increased steadily from 1970 to 1988 and then stagnated until 1993. It then increased steadily until 1997, levelling off in 1998. Because life expectancy in Hungary has not improved, life expectancy was about 2 years less than the EU average among both males and females in 1970, and this increased to almost 6 years for women and about 8 years for men in 1998 (Fig. 4â€“6). As in most of the reference countries, the gender difference in life expectancy at birth has increased in Hungary, from 8.1 years more for females in 1985 to 9.2 years in 1998. This difference was greater than the average difference in the reference countries in 1998 (8.4 years) and more than 2.5 years greater than the EU average in 1998 (6.6 years). Life expectancy differs substantially between urban and rural communities for men (Budapest 67.6 years, other cities 66.8 years and rural area 64.6 years), [...]
