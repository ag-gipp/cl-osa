The spleen is one of the in the blood circulation interstratified organs of the secondary lymphoid system. An activation of the immune system yields to the migration of the immune cells from the white pulp of lymphoid follicles to the blood circulation. The lymphocytes migrate along the chemotaxis gradient subsequently following over the red pulp, which was shown as a decrease of the lymphocyte abundance of the white pulp in the histopathological examinations. With its persistent progression the border between red and white pulp would disappear. Discrimination of the white and red spleen pulp was only preserved in the CCI group and impossible in the animals from the Fx-Shock group and polytrauma group. The results of this study speak for a strong mobilization of the lymphocytes from the lymphoid follicels of the spleen in the Fx-Shock group and the polytrauma group when compared to the CCI group underlying the value of the shock at this context. 

Finally, no abnormal histopathological findings were observed in the kidneys, as part of the a MODS, by examination of the glomerular abundance and infiltration with neutrophil granulocytes.
