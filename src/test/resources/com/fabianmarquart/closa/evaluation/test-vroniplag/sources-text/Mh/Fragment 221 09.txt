In general, Lettau’s results show that the GA is able to learn the optimum portfolio weight. However, there is an interesting bias. He finds that the optimal rules have a value for α which is greater than the optimal $ \alpha^* $ . This bias implies that they generally will be holding more of the stock than their preferences would prescribe. This is because agents are choosing $ \alpha^{**} = \arg\max\limits_{\alpha_i}\sum\limits_{j=1}^S U_{\alpha_i}(w_j) $, and $ E ( \alpha^{**} ) \neq \alpha^{*} $. Intuitively, the reason is quite simple. Over any finite sample, S, there will be a set of rules that do well because they faced a favorable draw of dividends. Those that took risks and were lucky will end up at the top of the fitness heap. Those that took risks and were unlucky will be at the bottom, and the conservative rules will be in the middle. As the GA evolves, this continues to suggest a selection pressure for lucky, but not necessarily skillful strategies. Pushing S to infinity exposes agents to more trials, and the chances of performing well do [sic!] to chance go to zero. Lettau shows that for very large S, the bias does indeed get close to zero as expected.
