[Seite 189] Film, too, creates a second reality by substituting images of people for people. The emergence of stars out of masses of canned people corresponds to the human need to identify, thus serving a function similar to that of trademarks in advertising. [Seite 193] In fact, there were considerable parallels in the processes of centralization concerning the food and film supply. The idea that cinema was food for the masses was already common in the Kino-Debatte before the War. Alfred Döblin, on visiting a smelly working-class movie theater in the north of Berlin in 1909, had declared that the people needed the very bloody diet of trashy dime novels and nickelodeons as ‘panem et circences’.11 Another German writer, Carl Hauptmann, characterized the surrogate function of cinema as ‘Zichorie statt Kaffee für das Volk’.12 Karl Hans Strobl, a writer of adventure novels, had described cinema in 1911 as ‘theater in top speed’ to which ‘the American principle’ of ‘the whole ox in the stock cube’ applied.13 In the pre-war years, the emergence of new modes of urban entertainment in German cities had led to a ‘leisure explosion’.14 Cinema was the most important of these new leisure facilities and gradually paved the way for the centralization of entertainment. [...] [...] In January 1915, by decree of the Bundesrat, the branches of foreign film companies (Pathé Frères, Gaumont, Literaria and others) were taken over by German administrators. However, foreign films still entered through neutral countries like Denmark and the Netherlands. On the whole, very little is known yet about the fate of foreign films in German cinemas during the War. Censorship entries reveal that American films produced by American Biograph, Selig, Tannhouser, IMP or Kalem (THE ADVENTURES OF HELEN HOLMES, for example, was prohibited for children in Berlin in [Seite 194] 1916) still made their way into Germany because the USA remained neutral until 1917.16 [...] In any case, the German film industry emerged strengthened from the War, [...] [...] The efforts to achieve national control of the film market could not fully come to fruition in the course of this war, but it opened up perspectives for the future. The War heated up the nationalist rhetoric used in the economic debates of the pre-war years. The rhetoric of national defense against ‘the American threat’ was also applied to the film industry.20 [Seite 195] In order to reconstruct the taste of early audiences, we can draw on documents by writers and artists who were enthusiastic about the potential of the new medium, but the silent majority that watched silent films still remains largely obscure, and its preferences need to be further examined. 11 Alfred Döblin, ‘Das Theater der kleine Leute’ (1909), Fritz Güttinger, Kein Tag ohne Kino: Schriftsteller über den Stummfilm, Frankfurt: Deutsches Filmmuseum, 1984, pp. 39-41.
