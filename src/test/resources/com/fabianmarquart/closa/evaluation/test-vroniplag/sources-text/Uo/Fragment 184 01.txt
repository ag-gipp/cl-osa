[Seite 77] Such depth shots look quite dramatic to us today, but they are so common in the early to mid-1910s that I suspect they originally functioned to convey the same information that the eyeline match was soon to fulfill more frequently. That is, film-makers who needed to show clearly that one character was watching another but who did not yet know about glance-object editing could employ this sort of depth staging. During the 1910s, however, many film-makers began to use this device of deep staging in a new way, placing a curtain in the foreground which the character or someone else pulls aside. Here I suspect the purpose is more to create a dramatic revelation of a new space than simply to show that a character is looking at something else. In FABIOLA, a 1917 Italian film (Enrico Guazzoni), the villain moves into the foreground (Fig. 20) and furtively parts the curtains to spy on the heroine (Fig. 21). By this point in film history, the eyeline match technique was presumably becoming known among film-makers internationally. Yet here the depth shot remains as a sort of flourish for the presentation of a new set. This function is quite clearly present in MADAME DUBARRY (1919, Ernst Lubitsch). [...] Here the heroine goes for the first time to dine with a wealthy man. She pauses expectantly by a curtain (Fig. 22), which is then drawn aside by an unseen hand, revealing the first of the film’s many rich interiors (Fig. 23). The fact that the man [Seite 78] she has come to visit is not yet present in the room reinforces the notion that here staging in depth functions primarily to create spectacle. Depth staging could also be used for other purposes. To give one brief example, the most famous shot from TERJE VIGEN (‘A Man There Was’, 1916, Victor Sjöström) juxtaposes the protagonist with the sea seen through a window as a storm is brewing. Here depth serves a poetic purpose, as part of a metaphorical linking of the tempestuous sea with Vigen’s desire for revenge. Camera Movement I shall say relatively little about camera movement, since this subject has been quite extensively researched. [...] Evgenii Bauer’s DITYA BOL’SHOGO GORODA (‘Child of the Big City’, released in early 1914, at about the same time as CABIRIA) tracks the camera slowly forward through the relatively large cabaret set (Fig. 24), dividing its attention between the heroine, at the right, and the stage beyond (Fig. 25). Griffith used camera movement for a narrational comment on the action [...] In INTOLERANCE, he underlines the Dear One’s shock after her husband’s death sentence with a short track-in as she walks slowly toward the camera, until she is slightly out of focus and a slow fade-out begins. Christensen’s HAEVENS NAT provides a rare example of camera movement being used for shock effect. He frames a young woman in a house at night, reacting in terror to something she sees off right front; as she struggles to open the door, the camera pulls back, seemingly directly through the closed French doors and continues to draw away from her; the intruder suddenly appears as a silhouette, breaking in and rushing forward to seize her.10 Such uses of expressive camera movement would be developed considerably by the French Impressionists and German film-makers in the 1920s. 10 For illustrations of two stages of this shot, see: Film History, Figs. 3.17 and 3.18, p. 64.
