[Seite 171] Cinema and German Politics in Occupied Belgium GUIDO CONVENTS In August 1914 the Germans invaded neutral Belgium and occupied most of the territory. At the end of that year the Germans ordered that daily life had to go on ‘normally’, although a lot of atrocities had been committed. One of the political aims of the Germans was to bring the Flemish-speaking Belgians - at that time something more than half of the population - over to their side. A special strategy, known as the Flamenpolitik, was worked out. At that time a Frenchspeaking elite dominated the political-economical and cultural life. The German occupation now gave an excellent opportunity to a small group of Flemish nationalists (activists), to obtain cultural and political monopoly in Flanders. They declared in 1917 the independence of Flanders (the northern part of the country) and founded the Raad voor Vlaanderen (‘Council for Flanders’), with a propaganda commission (Centraal Vlaamsch Propagandabureel) financed by the Germans. As the Flemish population did not admit any collaboration with the German invaders, propaganda for the activist cause was given a high priority.1 In September 1917, a provincial governor, Emile Beco, declared that just in the area of Brussels about 200.000 children were going every week to the pictures. According to a German officer, at that time there were about eighty cinemas in the Belgian capital. Beco stressed that the occupying forces were encouraging going the movies, because it led to a large quantity of tax-income. He also explained that a special organisation was founded in Berlin to export films and filmmaterial to Belgium. The organisation he was referring to must have been the Bild- und Filmamt.2 [...] Several statistical data indicate that in [Seite 172] this occupied country (seven million inhabitants) something like fifty million cinema and theater tickets were sold between June 1916 and June 1917. [...] [...] On 16 October 1914, the Belgian cinema industry discussed not only the new established censorship but also whether it was justified to show films in wartime. [...] Those who wanted to close down could have done so. But the remark was made that if the occupation lasted years, the functioning of the cinemas could be vital for the survival of their owners and staff.4 1 M. de Vroede, ‘Geknecht land.
