PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS AND RISK OF CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE There is considerable evidence that psychological factors contribute to the development of stroke by their effects on risk factors. High Blood Pressure A number of early studies have linked high blood pressure with psychosocial factors such as anxiety, repressed hostility, and psychological stress (Jacob et al., 1977; Weiner, 1979; Brody, 1980; Linden & Feuerstein, 1981; Taylor & Fortman, 1983). Studies among African Americans have shown that stress is direcdy related to blood pressure, and social support appears to modify the effect (Barnes et al., 1997; Strogatz et al., 1997). Models have been developed to describe how stress affects blood pressure. One of these is a tripartite model with these three components: environmental stressors, individual factors that affect the perception of stress (including cognitive appraisal and coping resources), and the individualâ€™s genedc susceptibility (Schwartz, Pickering, et al., 1996) (see chapter 17). Heart Disease Studies in both animals and humans have shown that brain stimulation can provoke cardiac arrhythmias (Lown et al., 1977) by increasing sympathetic nervous system activity (as is seen in psychological stress). Environmental stresses of a variety of types can injure the heart, lower the threshold for ventricular fibrillation, and provoke malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Numerous studies in humans have documented the relationship among stress, negative psychological states, and heart disease (Lukl, 1971; Raab, 1972; Friedman, 1976; Rosengren, Tibben, et al., 1991; Steenland et al., 1997; Carney, 1998) (see chapter 16).
