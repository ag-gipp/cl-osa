[Seite 78] Editing Continuity editing emerged during the 1910s as a system for creating coherent narrative space and time. Surprisingly quickly, however, film-makers discovered ways of using [Seite 80] editing for authorial comment, for enhancing suspense, for creating parallelism, and even for disorienting the viewer for various purposes. The ordinary cut-in had begun as a means for commenting on the action. In INTOLERANCE, for example, the introduction of the French court includes a detail shot of a small attendant hiding a yawn, hinting at the court's stultifying pomp. INTOLERANCE is famous as having emphasized the affecting detail, as when a general view of the Dear One collapsing after her child is taken away leads to a close view of the baby’s bootie. Another editing device that shows up occasionally in mid-1910s cinema is the expressive graphic match. [Anm.: Satz bei Uo ausgelassen] In the scene of the gangster’s death in INTOLERANCE, Griffith cuts from the Boy, hunched on the floor, to the Dear One, in a similar posture. Presumably this cut functions partly to show why neither sees who fires the shot, but it also enhances the emotional tone of the scene by stressing their mutual helplessness. In TERJE VIGEN, Sjostrom edits together a medium shot of several soldiers rowing (Fig. 26) and one of Vigen rowing as he tries to escape them (Fig. 27). The low framing and direction and rhythm of the gestures creates a graphic match that I think functions to add to the suspense. The shot/reverse shot editing pattern became common practice during the 1910s.
