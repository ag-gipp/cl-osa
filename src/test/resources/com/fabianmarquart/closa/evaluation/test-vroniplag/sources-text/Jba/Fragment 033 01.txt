Until 1990 the growth of health expenditure approximated the growth in the economy, but during the last ten years the growth in health expenditure has become greater. The costs of unification, the aging population and the introduction of new technologies have been listed as some of the possible reasons behind this increase (Iglehart 1991b, European Parliament 1998). In 1992, the shares of GDP spent on ambulatory medical care and medication were third highest in the EU, but spending on nursing care was just below the EU average despite a marked increase since 1980.
