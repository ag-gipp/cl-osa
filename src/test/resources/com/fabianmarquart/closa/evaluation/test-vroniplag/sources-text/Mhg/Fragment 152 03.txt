The focus theory will not be applicable under all circumstances. There may be situations where there are no foci, and there may be situations where other processes (e.g., based upon similarities or upon deliberate manipulations by the actors) override the effects of foci. However, where the focus theory does apply, it should provide a step toward understanding the relationship between the structure of social networks and other aspects of social structure.
