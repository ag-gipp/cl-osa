 

A generalized intracranial pressure increase is equally held responsible for that appearance also seen under other conditions (Wauchob et al., 1984; Hofstetter et al., 2007). Supposedly a traumatically reinforced massive temporary catecholamine distribution causes initially a hyperdyname circulation reaction (Clifton et al., 1981). The Î±-adrenergic stimulation and the associated intense constriction of the vessels cause a redistribution of the blood from the great circulation in the pulmonary circulation (Pace, 1977; Wauchob et al., 1984), in connection with an increase of the pulmonary hydrostatic pressure (Garcia-Uria et al., 1981; Maron and Dawson, 1979; Wauchob et al., 1984). This leads to an extended impairment of the capillary endothelium with consecutive increase in the extravascular lung water (Crittenden and Beckman, 1982). Further, catecholamine can lead to a neutrophil and PMN sequestration in the lungs (Boogs, 1975; Davis [et al., 1991; Morken et al., 2002).]
