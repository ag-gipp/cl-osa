The first of these groupings consisted of “libertarians” and “classical liberals,” resisting the threat of the ever-expanding State to liberty, free market capitalism, and individual initiative. Convinced in the 1940s that America was rapidly drifting toward expanded state planning and socialism - what Friedrich Hayek called “the road to serfdom”- these intellectuals offered a powerful defense of free market economics that achieved some scholarly and popular influence by the mid-1950’s. From men like Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, Henry Hazlitt and John Chamberlain in the 1940s and 1950s, to Milton Friedman and the Chicago School economists in the 1960s, to Arthur Laffer and the “supply side“ economists of the late 70’s and early ’80's, the “libertarians” - mostly economists - have produced a sophisticated defense of free market capitalism and have exerted enormous influence over the American Right. The Reagan administration’s policies of tax cutting, deregulation, and encouragement of private sector economic growth are the direct product of this rich intellectual legacy.
