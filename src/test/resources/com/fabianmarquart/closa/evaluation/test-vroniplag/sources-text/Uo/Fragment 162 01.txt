In November 1915, the Home Office in England forbade their Consul General in Copenhagen to sign the so-called certificates of origin for all Danish films. This meant that from now on no Danish film could be exported to England. Soon after, France and later Italy joined this blockade. [...] This blow hit all of Danish film production, and many of the minor companies, which for some time had had difficulties in surviving, now succumbed. For Nordisk as well this was a hard blow. In 1915 Nordisk could still present a yearly profit, which mainly arose from income from the associated German distribution companies. In 1916, the situation deteriorated. The stock of the company had to be raised to eight million crowns, not a good sign. As a result of the rather poor sale of prints, the company decided at the end of 1916 to give notice to all of its actors. They were told that they might be re-engaged next year, but only for one film at a time, not for the whole season. Not even the contract with Valdemar Psilander was renewed. But the worst blow for Nordisk fell in 1917, when the German state forced some of the foreign film companies working in Germany, among them Nordisk, to sell all their assets there to the German state. In the case of Nordisk, this meant that the company had to sell all its first-run cinemas and assets in German film distribution and production companies. As compensation Nordisk received ten million German marks, but with the devaluation of the German currency this represented a huge loss, as the company was not allowed to transfer the money to Denmark. The war made it difficult to export films from Europe to the USA, and therefore the American branch of Nordisk closed down in 1916. In 1917, the Russian Revolution broke out, which meant that still another great market disappeared for Nordisk. [Seite 45] Also, the large market of Austria-Hungary dwindled away. Finally only export to Norway, Sweden and Finland remained. Thanks especially to the popularity of the Danish film comedies, Nordisk was able to survive. [...] [...] From the very beginning Danish cinema had focused on the international market. It produced a kind of Hollywood film before this term was coined. The stories were international in their settings, so that they could easily be understood everywhere. This emphasis on being international became fatal, as during the war there was no contact with developments of film art in other countries, primarily in the USA. Of course, a few of Thomas Ince’s and D.W. Griffith’s early films had been shown before the war, but the great artistic strides of the American cinema did not reach Denmark until after 1918. [...] [...] Between 1914 and 1918 Danish film companies produced the same genres as they had done before the war: melodramas, crime films, literary films and light comedies.
