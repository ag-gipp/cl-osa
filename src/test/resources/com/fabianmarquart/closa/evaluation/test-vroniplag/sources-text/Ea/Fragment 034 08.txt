Second, most of the studies included in our meta-analysis were undertaken in white children with VTE; thus, it is unknown whether our findings can be extrapolated to other ethnic groups. A third limitation is the possible presence of publication bias. Although formal testing did not show a publication bias, it cannot be completely ruled out, considering the rarity of the disease and the small number of studies available in the field of pediatric VTE. [...] A fourth limitation of the study, specifically with regard to the VTE recurrence analysis, is that data were not available for the duration of follow-up on a per-patient level, so recurrence [Seite 1379] risk may be biased by differences in duration of follow-up across studies.
