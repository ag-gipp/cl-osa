[Seite 98] In the pre-war period, the gradual rise to dominance of ‘classical narrative’ within the film industry [Seite 99] had brought with it an injunction against formal devices which would break the illusion of a self-contained diegetic world.5 This injunction applied especially to looks at the camera. Beginning in 1909 in the United States, histrionic pantomime through which performers self-consciously presented themselves to the camera, was gradually displaced by naturalistic restraint.6 By the beginning of the First World War, European and American actors generally avoided looking or gesturing directly at the camera. Contemporary writings indicate that where such looks and gestures occurred in fiction films, they were likely to be perceived as transgressive. 5 According to Steve Neale, the textual operations of propaganda are fundamentally incompatible with the structures of mainstream narrative cinema. Propaganda marks the conflicts it deals with as real and exhorts the audience to work towards a resolution which the text itself cannot achieve. The ‘classic realist text’, however, removes the issues it raises from the social and political realities of its audience and works towards resolving them in purely textual terms, thus achieving formal closure and relieving the audience of the need for action.
