DM consisted of a period of prayer and quiet reading and pondering of biblical material. This technique was compared to progressive relaxation (PR). The interventions were delivered in six sessions of 20 minutes each over a two-week period. Subjects, who were 36 undergraduates at a Christian liberal arts college in the Chicago area, were randomly assigned by sex to either DM, PR, or a wait-list control group (WL). Heart rate and skin temperature were assessed, and electromyogram (EMG) was used to monitor tension in four muscle groups. [Seite 152] Subjects completed a variety of standard anxiety, tension, and emotional adjustment scales. Results indicated that subjects in the DM group experienced reduced muscle tension in two of four sites, whereas subjects in the PR group experienced increased tension in two of four muscle sites. Postintervention assessment revealed that anger and anxiety scores were significantly lower in the DM group compared to the PR group or the WL control group, although no physiological differences were observed.
