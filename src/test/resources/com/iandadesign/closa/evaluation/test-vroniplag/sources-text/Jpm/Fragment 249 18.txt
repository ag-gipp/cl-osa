Also evaluating the efficacy of an education intervention for hypertension among people attending African American churches, Smith (1992) trained six registered nurses from six inner-city African American churches to administer the intervention. The intervention, which provided information about the nature of and management strategies for hypertension, was administered to 32 individuals. Data were collected before, immediately after, and three months after the intervention. Smith found a statistically significant difference in knowledge between pre- and postintervention assessments. No significant changes, however, were noted in blood pressure readings or sodium intake. In a more recent follow-up study, Smith, Merritt, et al. (1997) trained church health educators to teach 97 African American subjects with hypertension how to manage their condition. Using a pretest/posttest design, investigators collected data on knowledge, social support, and blood pressure at baseline (pre), immediately postintervention (postl), and three months postintervention (post2). This study too found a significant increase in knowledge scores on pre- and postintervention assessments.
