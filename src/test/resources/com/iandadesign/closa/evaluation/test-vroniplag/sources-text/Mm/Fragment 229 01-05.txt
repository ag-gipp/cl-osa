Shocked by totalitarianism, total war, and the development of secular, rootless, mass society during the thirties and forties, the “new conservatives” (as they were then called) urged a return to traditional religious and ethical absolutes and a rejection of the moral “relativism” which had allegedly corroded Western values and produced an intolerable vacuum that was filled by demonic ideologies. More Europe-oriented than the classical liberals, the “new conservatives” extolled the wisdom of such European conservatives as Burke, Tocqueville, and Metternich and called for a revival of Christian orthodoxy, classical, natural law philosophy, and mediating institutions between citizen and state.
