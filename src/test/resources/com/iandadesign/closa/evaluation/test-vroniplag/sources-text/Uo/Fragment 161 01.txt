[Seite 176] However, the German authorities seemed reticent because a film company from Berlin had already laid plans for the same film, and having so many people in the war zone around Courtray could attract spies.17 On 10 October 1918, Staehle announced to BUFA that the stage play written by René Maes, ‘Waarom’ (‘Why’), was being filmed. Maes was responsable for the press office of the regional Hemish Council (Gouwraad) at Courtray. ‘Waarom’ [Seite 177] showed Flemish soldiers in the Belgian army (fighting against the Germans) and the way they were humiliated by their (French-speaking) officers. The actors were also ‘soldiers from the Front’ (meaning Flemish soldiers who were captured by the Germans, or who had crossed the front lines to give themselves up to the Germans). But there are indications that the roles were played by professional actors from the German theater. What happened after 10 October is unknown, but it is unlikely that the Germans or Flemish activists produced much in the last month of the war. 17 ‘Het aktivistisch avontuur’, p. 280.
