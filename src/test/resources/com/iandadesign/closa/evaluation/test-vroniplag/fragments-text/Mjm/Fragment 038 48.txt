Regarding the density of the reactive astrocytes in the left cortex (trauma side) a highly significant difference between the different groups (p &lt; 0.001) was evident. The largest astrocyte density was exhibited in the polytrauma group with 437 ± 28 astrocytes/mm2. The CCI group followed with 345 ± 43 astrocyts/mm2, the density for the Fx-Shock group was 79 ± 16 astrocytes/mm2. In contrast, the astrocyte density in the right side (untraumatized side) exhibited no significant differences with 89 ± 20 astrocytes/mm2 in the Fx-Shock group, 90 ± 45 astrocytes/mm2 in the CCI group and 109 ± 27 astrocyte/mm2 in the polytrauma group. On the left side (trauma side) of the hippocampus (CA1, CA2, CA3 regions and gyrus dentatus) highly significant differences between the three groups were present in terms of the astrocyte density. The astrocyte density in this area was the highest in the polytrauma group with 538 ± 70 astrocytes/mm2, followed by the CCI group with 429 ± 65 astrocytes/mm2 and the Fx-Shock group with 306 ± 26 astrocytes/mm2. The differences in terms of the astrocyte density in the left hippocampus were significant (p = 0.040) between the Fx-Shock group and the CCI group and highly significant (p = 0.001) between the Fx-Shock group and the polytrauma group. The comparison of the CCI group and the polytrauma group resulted in a tendency (p = 0.068). In terms of the astrocyte density, the right side of the hippocampus (untraumatized side) showed a tendency (p = 0.078) when comparing the different groups. The calculation produced 404 ± 54 astrocytes/mm2 in the polytrauma group, 339 ± 67 in the CCI group, and 307 ± 31 astrocytes/mm2 in the Fx-Shock group. A close correlation between the left and right sides of the hippocampus could be observed (correlation coefficient r = 0.861, p &lt; 0.001).
