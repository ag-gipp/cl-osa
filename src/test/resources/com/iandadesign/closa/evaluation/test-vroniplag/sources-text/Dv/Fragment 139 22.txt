Matters came to a head after November 1840, when New York officials arrested a Canadian deputy sheriff from Niagara named Alexander McLeod, and charged him with arson and murder in connection with The Caroline. The British protested, but Secretary Forsyth responded that the federal government could not intervene in a state criminal prosecution. The British insisted that McLeod was innocent, and that in any event he could not be prosecuted as a private individual, since what he had done was ofﬁcially sanctioned. After William Harrison took office as President, Daniel Webster became Secretary of State. In March 1841, he invited the British to avow The Caroline incident and on that basis to request McLeod’s release. The British Minister Fox obliged immediately, and Webster set about securing McLeod’s release, with the approval of President Tyler, who assumed power upon Harrison’s death.
