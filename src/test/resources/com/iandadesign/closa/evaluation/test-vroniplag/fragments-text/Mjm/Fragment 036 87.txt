3.1. Lung 

The majority of the animals in the three groups exhibited minimal pulmonary edema. All animals in the CCI group exhibited a notable pulmonary edema. The percentages of the varying severities of the interstitial pulmonary edema demonstrated by the swelling of the alveolar septae, in the different experiment groups, is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows the percentages of the varying severities of the infiltration of the neutrophil granuloctyes in the pulmonary tissue in the three experiment groups.
