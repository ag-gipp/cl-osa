In 1974, Lord Denning MR said that the incoming tide of Community law could not be held back. 'Parliament has decreed that the Treaty is henceforward to be part of our law. It is equal in force to any statute.59 The crucial question, however, was not whether Community law has the same force as a statute, but whether it has greater force than a statute by prevailing over subsequent Acts which may be in conflict with it. Some light on the problem was cast by cases concerning equal pay for men and women, an area in which Community law went further than national law in imposing a duty on employers to treat men and women equally. Westminster legislated on this subject in the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. But by Article 119 of the EEC Treaty, Member States must maintain the principle that men and women receive equal pay for equal work. The European Court held that this Article creates rights directly enforceable by an individuai against the employer, even though these rights go beyond those arising out of national legislation on equal pay60 Ordinarily courts and tribunals in Britain apply national legislation, but it is now established that they must recognize and protect the rights of employees under directly effective provisions of Community law.61 We have already seen that by section 2 (4) of the European Communities Act 1972 any existing or future national enactment 'shall be construed and shall have effect' subject to the directly effective provisions of Community law. Relying on the words quoted, the courts have taken the view that where possible national legislation is to be interpreted and applied so that it does not conflict with Community law.62 In Garland v. British Rail Engineering Ltd.,63 Lord Diplock stated that where a statute relating to 'British treaty obligations' had to be construed, and the statutory words were reasonably capable - 'without undue straining of the ordinary meaning of language'- off bearing a meaning that was consistent with those treaty obligations, they should be given that meaning. 59 H.P.
