B.1.4.2 RTX-toxins The hemolysins of A. pleuropneumoniae belonging to the family of RTX toxins (RTX â€“ repeat in toxin) are widely spread among gram-negative pathogenic bacteria (WELCH 1991). Biochemical and biophysical analyses revealed that they have repetitive, glycin-rich sequences of nine amino acids in length near the carboxy terminus. They are pore-forming proteins with hemolytic activity and/or toxicity towards nucleated cells (FREY a. NICOLET 1988; GENTSCHEV et al. 2002; THOMPSON et al. 1993). FREY, J. a. J.
