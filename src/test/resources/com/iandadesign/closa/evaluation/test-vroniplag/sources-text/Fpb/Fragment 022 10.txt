The proteins of the pRb family have been shown to play a pivotal role in regulating cell cycle progression and cell cycle reentry not only in SMCs [6-9]. These proteins, pRb, p130 and p107, function in a cell cycle dependent manner to regulate the activity of numerous important cellular transcription factors such as the E2F family, [...].
