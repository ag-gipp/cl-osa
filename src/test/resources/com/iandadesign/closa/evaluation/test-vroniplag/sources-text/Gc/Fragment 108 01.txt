It is also interesting to look at the regional distribution of Internet activities. About 70 per cent of Internet websites are located in the United States; another 8 per cent are reported for Canada, 14 per cent for Europe, 4 per cent for Asia/Pacific and 2.3 per cent for Latin America and Africa. However, Europe, Asia and the other world regions are likely to catch up in terms of Internet sites and users in the coming years. [...] Africa, Asia, and Latin America have reported the highest growth rates for the period between 1993 and 1996, and all regions outside the United States are expected to gain market share over the next 3-4 years (Chart 8). The share of Internet users from Europe and Asia in the world, for example, is likely to grow to 25 and 15 per cent, respectively, by 2000 (ITU, 1997a). Internet-generated revenue is regionally even more concentrated than the number of websites. Over 85 per cent of world revenue in 1996/97 was generated in the United States, whereas the United Statesâ€™ share of users only amounted to 62 per cent (ActivMedia, 1997). By 2001, however, the share of European web-revenue will have more than doubled from about 5 per cent to over 10 per cent of total online sales (IDC, 1997).
