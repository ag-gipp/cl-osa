The trends within the EU for mortality from these factors, and in particular from road traffic accidents, have been going down since 1970. As can be seen from the corresponding graphs, this general trend was followed in the previous territories of the Federal Republic of Germany for both men and women, while in the former GDR it is actually very difficult to draw any conclusions from the information available. On the one hand, the sharp variations observed suggest possible problems in the coding procedures. On the other hand, it is likely that mortality from road traffic accidents in the new Länder did in fact rise after 1990, as faster cars became more widely available, motor vehicle traffic increased considerably and the road conditions did not immediately improve. In 1993, mortality from both external causes in general and motor vehicle accidents in particular was higher in the new Länder than in the other parts of Germany. Nevertheless, during the previous ten years the SDRs for both sexes fell by more than in most of the reference countries and in 1993 were somewhat below the EU average. The risk of dying in a road traffic accident in Germany equals the EU average (13 per 100 000 people), but the risk of being injured in such an accident is high: 641 per 100 000 population in 1992, well above the EU average of 477 per 100 000 (Eurostat 1995a). As the death rates from road traffic accidents have decreased since 1980, so have the rates of injury. This drop is particularly obvious if the increase in traffic over that period is taken into consideration, which indicates that there was some evidence of real progress in road safety.
