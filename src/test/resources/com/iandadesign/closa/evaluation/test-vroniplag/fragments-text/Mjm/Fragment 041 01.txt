[How-] ever, these animals showed a partially high density of reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus, while they did not reach the values of the CCI and polytrauma group. As mentioned above, in these two groups with traumatic brain injury a rather strong astrogliosis was observed bilaterally in the hippocampus. A highly significant reactive gliosis in polytraumatized animals was discovered in the ipsilateral cortex and in the bilateral hippocampus, and with it, a stronger reaction to the polytrauma as to each single trauma in reference to progressive degenerative and regenerative processes. Consequently, it could prove an influence of the traumatic hemorrhagic shock, which is distinctly amplified through the traumatic brain injury activated gliosis.
