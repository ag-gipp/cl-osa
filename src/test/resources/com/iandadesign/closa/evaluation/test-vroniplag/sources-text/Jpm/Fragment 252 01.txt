Cigarette Smoking A number of studies report that psychological stress increases the desire to smoke cigarettes (Pomerleau & Pomerleau, 1991; Perkins 8c Gorbe, 1992), increases the likelihood of smoking during adolescence (Byrne et al., 1995), and can be linked to the physical health consequences of smoking (Colby et al., 1994). Coping strategies and social support have been shown to influence smoking behavior by providing alternative behavioral and cognitive outlets for dealing with stress (Sussman et al., 1993; Steptoe et al., 1996) (see chapter 24). Diabetes Psychological and social factors can affect the onset and course of diabetes mellitus (Surwit et al., 1992; Wales, 1995). Findings from different clinical investigators working in a variety of settings have documented the disruptive effects of emotional distress on diabetic control (Evans, 1985) and the development of diabetic complications (Lloyd et al., 1991). Neural and hormonal responses to emotional stress induce an energy mobilization response that diabetics (either juvenile onset or adult onset) cannot easily counterregulate (Surwit et al., 1992). For example, Inui et al. (1998) examined diabetic control (as measured by Hemoglobin A1C levels) in those exposed to a life-threatening earthquake that resulted in either severe damage to their homes or death or severe injury to relatives. Earthquake-exposed diabetics had significandy worse diabetic control than the unexposed diabetics. Other studies have shown that effective coping with chronic psychosocial stress can prevent its disruptive effects on glycemic control (Peyrot & McMurry, 1992).
