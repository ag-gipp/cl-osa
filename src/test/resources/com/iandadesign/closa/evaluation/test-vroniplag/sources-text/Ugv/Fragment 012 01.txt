[Seite 700] [Four maternal deaths occurred in the first phase of the study when patients were not routinely managed with prompt induction of labor.] In that same period, ten of 52 infants (19%) born to mothers with amnionitis died. [...] In 1967 Webb15 evaluated 54 cases of maternal death associated with PROM. Thirty-one deaths occurred in women at greater than or equal to 36 weeks' gestation, and most were the direct result of overwhelming infection. [Forty-three of the 54 infants (80%) died.] In an excellent review, Gunn et al9 observed that 9.1% of patients with PROM developed amnionitis.
