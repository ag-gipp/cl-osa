Table 1 Contractile behaviour of skinned human papillary muscle in different types of mitral valve disease as obtained under isometric conditions by the force clamping technique. [TABELLE, siehe hier] CMV: combined mitral valve disease, MVS: mitral valve stenosis, MVI: mitral valve incompetence, T: steady state isometric force development before induction of vibration, T-clamp: steady state force during force clamping, T<sub>ss</sub>: steady state force development following cessation of vibration, β: time constant of the time course of force recovery after induction of vibration induced force clamping, T/mm<sup>2</sup>: maximum force per square mm following cessation of vibration.
