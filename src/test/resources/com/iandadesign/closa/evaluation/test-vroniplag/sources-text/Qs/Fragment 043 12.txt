Aesculap Orthopaedics Columbus® Knee system Operating technique [Seite 4] Preoperative planning The Columbus® knee system provides x-ray templates which help the surgeon to define the following parameters: ▶ Angle between the anatomical and the mechanical femoral axis ▶ Resection height of the intact tibia joint surface ▶ Entry points for the intramedullary alignment rods ▶ Size of the implants ▶ Position of the osteophytes The following x-rays are required to conduct the x-ray analysis: ▶ Knee joint in a.p.-projection: knee in extension, centred over the distal patella. ▶ Knee joint in lateral projection: knee in 30° flexion, centred over the distal patella. ▶ Whole leg x-ray in supported monopodal stance. ▶ Patella-tangential x-ray: knee in 30° flexion, caudocranial radiation, centred over distal patella. The Columbus® x-ray templates must be used. The angle between the mechanical and anatomical femoral axis is measured using the whole leg template. The joint centre, joint line and mechanical femoral axis are visible on the x-ray template and are brought into alignment with the x-ray image.
