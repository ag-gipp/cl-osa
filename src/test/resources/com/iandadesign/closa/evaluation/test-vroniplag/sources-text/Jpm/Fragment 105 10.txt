College students who volunteered for the study were randomly assigned to one of three groups regardless of their spiritual beliefs. The 25 students in the spiritual meditation group were told to concentrate on a phrase such as "God is love" or "God is peace" during their meditation periods. Those in the secular meditation group used a phrase such as "I am happy" or "I am joyful" while the third group were simply told to relax. Subjects were asked to practise their technique for 20 minutes each day for two weeks, at the beginning and end of which the researchers used psychological profiling to assess their mood. They also tested pain tolerance as measured by the amount of time the volunteers could keep their hands in water at 2 Â°C (Journal of Behavioral Medicine, DOI: 10.1007/s10865-005-9008-5). Those practising spiritual meditation showed greater reductions in anxiety than the other two groups and were able to keep their hands in the cold water for nearly double the time - on average 92 seconds versus 49 for the relaxation group. Amy Wachholtz of Bowling Green State University in Ohio, who conducted the research, says that spiritual meditation brings more than just deeper relaxation. "It is also likely that there is something unique inherent in the practice of spiritual meditation that cannot be completely conveyed through secular meditation and relaxation," she says, but admits that she doesn't know what it is.
