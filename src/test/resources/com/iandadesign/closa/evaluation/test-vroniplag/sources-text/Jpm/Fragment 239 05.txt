Carson and Huss (1979) conducted an intervention study with 20 Christian schizophrenic patients in a state mental hospital. The intervention was weekly prayer and Scripture reading conducted one on one by a student nurse for 10 weeks. The focus of prayer and Scripture readings was God’s love and concern for each individual and the worth of each individual to God. Student nurses and patients wrere assessed at the beginning and at the end of the 10-wreek project. Student nurses experienced several benefits — a greater sensitivity to others, a strengthening of their religious beliefs, and a greater sense of being hopeful, realistic, and empathetic. Patients became more verbal about what bothered them, acted out their anger and frustration more, and were more willing to take risks in expressing their inner feelings. Patients who received the intervention were also more likely than control patients to express a desire for change in their lives and for a more normal life. Compared to the controls, patients who received the intervention became more articulate, showed more appropriate affect, and complained of fewer somatic symptoms.
