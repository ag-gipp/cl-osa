Their work on questionnaire surveys among financial practitioners motivated Frankel and Froot (1986,1990ab) to develop a heterogeneous agent model for exchange rates with time varying weights of forecasting strategies, which has stimulated much subsequent research in the field. Their exchange rate model contains three classes of agents: fundamentalists, chartists and portfolio managers. Fundamentalists think of the exchange rate according to a model –e.g. the overshooting model– that would be exactly correct if there were no chartists in the market. Chartists do not have fundamentals in their information set; instead they use autoregressive time series models –e.g. simple extrapolation– having only past exchange rates in the information set. Finally portfolio managers, the actors who actually buy and sell foreign assets, form their expectations as a weighted average of the predictions of fundamentalists and chartists. Portfolio managers update the weights over time in a rational, Bayesian manner, according to whether the fundamentalists or the chartists have recently been doing a better job of forecasting. Thus each of the three is acting rationally subject to certain constraints. [...] The departure is a general model of exchange rate determination $ s_t = c\Delta s^m_{t+1} + z_t, c \geq 0 $, where $ s_t $ is the log of the spot exchange rate, $ \Delta s^m_{t+1} $ is the rate of depreciation expected by the market, i.e. by the portfolio managers, and $ z_t $, represents market fundamentals. [...] Fundamentalists’ forecast are given by $ \Delta s^f_{t+1}= v(\bar{s} - s_t) $, where $ \bar{s} $ is the fundamental exchange rate and $ v $ is the speed of adjustment. For simplicity, Frankel and Froot (1990b) assume that the ‘chartists’ believe that the exchange rate follows a random walk, that is, $ \Delta s^c_{t+1} = 0 $
