The electronic marketplace will reinforce the ongoing trend towards globalisation, which, as trade figures show, is gathering speed. As a share of world output, trade has more than tripled since 1950 - from 7 per cent to over 22 per cent. Investment, too, has become a powerful force for economic integration with cumulative assets of foreign investment trebled since 1987 - to over 2.5 trillion ECU. A significant proportion of trade in money markets takes place on-line. The daily volume of foreign exchange deals worldwide exceeds 1,000 billion ECU [FN 19: Financial Times - "The Banker", 27.11.97].
