The number of recorded road accidents decreased by more than one quarter between 1992 and 1996 (Ministry of Welfare, 1997b) and the number of people injured in road accidents declined by one third between 1990 and 1995 (National Institute of Public Health, 1997). The SDR for homicide and purposeful injury increased slowly until 1993 but decreased after that. It still remains above the EU average and the average for the reference counties, although it is much lower than in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
