3.5. Brain 

These examinations showed regular cavities with a mild damage to the brain cortex, mostly limited to the upper cortex layers, of the animals of the CCI and olytrauma group. The most prominent damages here were ringlike at the brink of the impact. Edematous cortex swelling triggered by the CCI on the left (trauma) side in comparison to the right (untraumatized) side could be recorded by measurement of the relative thickness of the cortex. The differences between the experiment groups were highly significant (p = 0.008). The relative cortex thickness amounts to 1.00 ± 0.01 in the Fx-Shock group, 1.09 ± 0.03 in the CCI group, and 1.12 ± 0.06 in the polytrauma group. Significant differences were shown between the Fx-Shock group and the polytrauma group (p = 0.010) as well as between the Fx-Shock group and the CCI group (p = 0.037).
