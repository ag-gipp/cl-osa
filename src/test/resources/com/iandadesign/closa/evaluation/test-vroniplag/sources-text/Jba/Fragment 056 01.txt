AN OVERVIEW The natural population growth in Hungary fell below zero in 1981, much earlier than in any of the reference countries.[1] This was caused by a decline in the birth rate and relatively high mortality rates. Hungary’s life expectancy at birth was among the lowest in the reference countries between 1970 and 1998. Life expectancy among males generally decreased from 1970 to 1993 and then rose by 1997 to the same level as in 1970. Female life expectancy increased steadily from 1970 to 1988, stagnated until 1993, and rose thereafter. For both sexes, life expectancy in Hungary was about 2 years less than the EU average in 1970. By 1998, this gap had widened to 6 years for women and 8 years for men. The mortality rates among men aged 35–65 years were almost as high in the mid-1990s as they were in the early 1920s. In the 1970s and 1980s, the standardized death rate (SDR) for cardiovascular diseases in the age group 0–64 years was among the highest in the reference countries, remaining static until the early 1990s. Since then the rates for both sexes have declined and are approaching the average for the reference countries. The SDR for cancer in the age group 0–64 years was close to the EU average in 1970, but rose rapidly to be the highest among the reference countries. During the 1990s, Hungary’s rate has continued to rise, whereas the rates in most of the other reference countries have fallen. In 1998, Hungary had by far the highest cancer mortality among people 0–64 years old of any country in the WHO European Region. Hungary’s SDR for external causes for all ages is the highest of the reference countries excluding Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, although there has been a slight decrease in the 1990s. Hungary had the highest SDR for suicide in the 1970s and the 1980s, but the rate has decreased markedly since the mid-1980s. Despite this improvement, the rate is still the highest among the reference countries excluding Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Among causes of mortality other than those mentioned above, the SDR for diseases of the digestive system for all ages is the highest among the reference countries, as is its main component – mortality from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. The incidence of AIDS is higher than the median of the reference countries but much lower than the EU average.
