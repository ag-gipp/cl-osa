[S. 117, re Sp. 6-16] Many studies have examined the relationship between religious involvement and psychological well-being. [...] Almost 80% of the 100 studies that have statistically examined the religion-well-being relationship report a positive correlation between religiousness and greater happiness, life satisfaction, morale, or other measure of well-being. [S. 135, li Sp. 9-28, 35-38.1-2] Research on religion and depression supports five conclusions. First, the data on religious affiliation and depression suggests that two religious groups — Jews and people who are not affiliated with any religion — are at elevated risk for depressive disorder and depressive symptoms. These findings have been replicated across a number of large, well-designed studies. Second, some aspects of religious involvement are indeed associated with less depression. People who are involved frequently in religious community activity and who highly value their religious faith for intrinsic reasons may be at reduced risk for depression. Even when these persons experience depression, available research suggests that they recover more quickly from it than those who are not religious. Conversely, people who are involved in religion for reasons of self-interest or extrinsic gain are at higher risk for depression. [...] Third, certain measures of religious involvement -particularly private religious activities and religious beliefs- are not as strongly related to depression as are organizational religious activities or intrinsic religious commitment.
