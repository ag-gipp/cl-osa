Note issue had previously been undertaken by the individual cantonal banks, some 36 in 1881.[4] Earlier in the nineteenth century, "it was very difficult to popularize these bank notes, the security of which was doubted, not without some reason. Outside their home Canton they would either not be given in payment at all or only at a certain discount."[5] The first step toward improving the position was the adoption of a concordat in 1862 among the stronger banks, "to accept one another's notes in payment, and started a kind of clearing and circulating system among themselves."[6}
