The debate over the legality of the British action began with a note dated 5 January 1838, from Secretary Forsyth to the British Minister in Washington, D.C., Henry S. Fox, calling the attack on The Caroline 'an extraordinary outrage', requesting a full explanation, [...] and calling for the aggressors to be punished. Forsyth demanded redress on 19 January [...]. Fox responded promptly. [...] A 'necessity of self defence and self preservation', he argued, gave them the right to destroy the 'piratical' vessel within US territory. [...] [FN 22] [FN 21] K. R.
