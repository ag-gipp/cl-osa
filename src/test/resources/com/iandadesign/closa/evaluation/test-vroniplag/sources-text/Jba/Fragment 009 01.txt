When asked in 1990-1992 how they would describe their current state of health, some 15% of the population aged 25-69 years reported their health as poor, and some 45% felt well or very well, the lowest percentage among the countries where this information is available. This result may be partly explained by the fact that the youngest (and usually the healthiest) group was not represented in the sample. The percentage of those who reported their health as poor was somewhat higher in women; as expected, it increased with age (Federal Ministry of Health 1994).
