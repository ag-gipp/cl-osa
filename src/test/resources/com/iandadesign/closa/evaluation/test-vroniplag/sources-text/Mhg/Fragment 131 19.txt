[Seite 1201] In considering the Community Question, sociologists have been espe- [Seite 1202] cially concerned with assessing the impact of industrialization and bureaucratization on a variety of primary ties: in the neighborhood, in kinship groups, in interest groups, and on the job. Urban sociologists, in particular, have been interested in this matter. From Tönnies ([1887] 1955) to Fischer (1977), they have investigated the effects of industrial bureaucratic social systems on communal structures, with particular reference to the following: (a) the increased scale of the nation-state’s activities, with a concomitant low level of local community autonomy and solidarity (e.g., Tilly 1973, 1975); (b) the development of narrowly instrumental bureaucratic institutions for production and reproduction (cf. Castells 1976); (c) the large size of cities, with the consequent population and organizational potential for diverse interest groups; (d) the high social density of interactions among the segments of the population (even where spatial density is low), with the ensuing complexities of organizational and ecological sorting;2 (e) the diversity of persons with whom city dwellers can come into contact under conditions of heightened mobility; and (f) widespread networks of cheap and efficient transportation facilities, letting contact be maintained with greater ease and over longer distances (cf. Meier 1968). 2 [...] Castells, Manuel. 1976. “Is There an Urban Sociology?” Pp. 33–59 in Urban Sociology: Critical Essays, edited by C. G. Pickvance. London: Methuen. Fischer, Claude S.
