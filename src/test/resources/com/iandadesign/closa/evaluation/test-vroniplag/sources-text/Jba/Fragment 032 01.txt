Wide regional disparities persist, e.g. in 1992 there were 6.5 beds per 1000 population in Schleswig-Holstein, but 10.6 in Bremen and 11.0 in Berlin (Statistisches Jahrbuch 1994). Historically long-term care was only available in hospitals. Therefore at times people were admitted not only for medical reasons. To rectify this situation a new law was introduced in 1995 providing for longterm care insurance to support care at home by the family members or neighbours (Federal Ministry of Health 1997a). Since April 1995, benefits for homenursing care have been granted and benefits for semiinstitutional nursing care and short-term hospital care were introduced in July 1996. This scheme is financed separately either by a statutory or a private insurance (Federal Ministry of Health 1997b). [Seite 40] Private sector There is little difference between the public and private sectors concerning secondary care. Most hospitals are publicly owned and 15% of hospitals, but less than 7% of all hospital beds are in the private for profit sector (Iglehart 1991b, European Parliament 1998). Health expenditure International comparisons of health care indicators are extremely difficult because the definitions underlying health statistics as well as accounting practices vary from one country to another. A comprehensive study (Schneider et al. 1995) tried to improve comparability by presenting a set of indicators based on adjusted national data. Germany is one of the EU countries with the largest share of its GDP spent on health (10.3% in 1994).
