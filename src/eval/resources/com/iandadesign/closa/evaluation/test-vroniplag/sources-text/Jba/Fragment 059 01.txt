The objectives of future reforms include: further decentralizing the financing and delivery of health care services, reducing the overall social insurance contribution, reforming the insurance collection system and further privatization of the family physicianâ€™s practice (WHO Regional Office for Europe, 1999a). Organizational structure The reformed Hungarian health services comprise three basic tiers: National, including the Ministry of Health, other relevant ministries, the National Health Insurance Fund Administration, and a range of other specialist national bodies such as the National Ambulance Service, the National Public Health and Medical Officer Service, and a range of professional organizations and unions. Sub-national, including county and municipal governments managing health care facilities, branches of the insurance fund administration, and local offices of the public health service. Private providers of care, such as private hospitals and pharmacies. Broadly speaking, the national level is concerned with regulation, policy and planning. The sub-national government level manages health care facilities, and contracts for primary health care with independent primary care providers. The county and municipal offices of the public health service monitor the public health and address public health concerns. The county branches of the insurance fund contract with private and state owned health care providers. The private sector is concerned with service provision.
