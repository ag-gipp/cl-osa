A large percentage of those women who do decide to have children decide to stay at home. In half of the families with children under six years old, only the partner works and in the cases where the mothers are employed and the children are still at a pre-school age, employment is primarily part-time (80 percent). In total only 66 percent of women work in Germany â€“ significantly less than in Sweden or the USA, where approximately 77 percent and 69 percent of the mothers work respectively.[FN 39]
