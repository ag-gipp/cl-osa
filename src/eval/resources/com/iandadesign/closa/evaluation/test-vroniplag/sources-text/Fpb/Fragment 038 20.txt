Several in vitro and in vivo models have been established illuminating the role of various factors causing SMC proliferation and neointima formation after mitogenic stimulation or after arterial injury [20]. Studies on cytostatic gene therapy overexpressing pRb or p130 [10,11] in animal vascular injury models revealed a significant reduction in neointima formation due to decreased SMC proliferation.
