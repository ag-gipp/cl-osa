The initial reforms from 1987 were followed up in 1990–1994 with more major reforms – decentralization, introduction of performancebased methods of paying providers, public health reform and giving priority to primary care. In 1991 the National Public Health and Medical Officer Service was established. It was based on the Network of Hygiene and Epidemiological Offices. After this, health care reform slowed because of the fiscal crisis and the economic stabilization programme. Between 1990 and 1994, the division of responsibilities between the state and local government was redefined. The state retained direct ownership of health care facilities for specialist services, University hospitals, national institutes and army hospitals, only. The ownership of the primary care surgeries, outpatient clinics and hospitals was transferred to local governments, which also became responsible for maintenance and investment.

Since 1995, legislation has defined the minimum requirements in terms of equipment and personnel institutions need to get a licence.
