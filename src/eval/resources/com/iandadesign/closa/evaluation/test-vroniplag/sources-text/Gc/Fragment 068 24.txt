Assessing the quantitative economic importance of “electronic commerce” quantitatively requires a definition of what should be counted under this term. If payments by credit card are included, electronic commerce would indeed be very large already. However, the payment stage is only one element of a commercial transaction. A key element is the acceptance of an offer through an electronic channel. Statistics on electronic commerce, therefore, typically look at such purchasing decisions and report sales or revenue through electronic channels. As noted, only the Internet allows all elements of many types of commercial transactions to be conducted electronically. But most electronic commerce is conducted through a combination of electronic channels (for example, telephone plus television or Internet plus telephone), in combination with paper (phone and mail), or in conjunction with physical shopping or delivery.
