Main causes of death Cancers are the most frequent cause of death under the age of 65 years, followed by CVDs. However over all ages the situation is reversed and CVDs cause more deaths than cancers. A more detailed analysis of age-specific mortality patterns shows that the causes of up to 80% of all deaths in each age group can be classified in three main categories: external causes4 (by far the main causes until the age of 35 years), cancers and CVDs. 4: This category includes all mortality due to poisoning, suicide, homicide and all types of accidents.
