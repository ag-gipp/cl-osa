The three leading French companies, Pathé Frères, Gaumont and Eclair, had local offices in the three empires. By the strength of their share in the market, they no doubt had an influence on the subjects, style, and artistic trends of a film production in most of the European countries. The only foreign firms that could compete with the French were Nordisk Film from Denmark, Cines from Italy and, to a lesser degree, IMP Film of America. [...] Though French companies dominated the foreign distribution of films in Western Europe, in the Central and Eastern European countries they had to give first place to Denmark. This small country was the centre of cinema art or, if one speaks in a more modest way, the centre of the artistic fashions in 1913. One may compare the role of Copenhagen with the dictatorship of Hollywood in later years. The Danish psychological film with a lot of sex and mostly tragic endings was a favourite of cinema programmes.
