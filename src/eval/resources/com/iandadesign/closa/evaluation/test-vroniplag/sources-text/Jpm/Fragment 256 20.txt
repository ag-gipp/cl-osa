[S14] Even if one explicitly rejects the existence of the transcendent, one has a relationship with itâ€”at least by way of rejecting it. By this broad definition, even an atheist has a spirituality because an atheist must search for personal meaning and value in light of his or her rejection of the possibility of a transcendent source of personal meaning and value. By contrast, a religion is a specific set of beliefs about the transcendent, held in common by a community of persons, usually in association with a particular language used to describe spiritual experiences and a communal sharing of key beliefs, along with particular associated practices, texts, rituals, and teachings. [S162] This definition suggests that spirituality is different from religion; moreover, by this definition everyone can claim to have a spirituality. This point is especially important because of the large number of Americans who consider themselves "spiritual but not religious."2
