[Seite 257, li. Sp., Z. 0, 13-27] Table 2 Contractile behaviour of skinned human papillary muscle in mitral valve disease as estimated by afterloaded contractions. [TABELLE, siehe hier] CMV: combined mitral valve disease, MVS: mitral valve stenosis, MVI: mitral valve incompetence, ML: muscle length at a resting force of 2 mN, Diameter: diameter at a resting force of 2 mN, Vmax: maximum velocity of shortening at zero load, b: 1/Vmax: ratio between time constant of force recovery after force clamping and the inverse value of Vmax. (Mean ± SEM) [...] 4) Relationship between isometric and isotonic measurements As each of the muscle fibres was subjected to isometric and isotonic measurements, the time constants of postvibration force recovery and Vmax could be directly compared. The time constant b is inversely correlated to Vmax (26). The data pairs of any type of mitral valve disease showed a characteristic straight-line relationship between both parameters (Fig. 6). However, the slope was different depending on the type of the underlying disease. Similarly the ratio between b and 1/Vmax differed significantly between various types of mitral valve disease. For mitral valve stenosis the ratio was 23,72 ± 0.49 (n = 6). Combined mitral valve disease had a ratio of 22.22 ± 0.57 (n = 6) and mitral valve incompetence had a ratio of 17.39 ± 0,29 (n = 7) (p < 0.0001). [S. 260, re. Sp., Z. 5-9] [EN 26] Vahl C. F., R.
