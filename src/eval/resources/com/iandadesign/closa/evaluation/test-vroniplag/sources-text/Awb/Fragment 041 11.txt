[ABBILDUNG, siehe hier] Fig. 4 Calculation of the maximum velocity at zero load. Data of 4 patients are given as examples. Shortening is expressed in % of Lmax/3 s and the force is given as % of isometric steady-state force. A hyperbolic function was fitted to the data pairs irrespective of the underlying disease. As shortening occurred within 3 s a third of these values represents Vmax in %ML/s as given in Table 2.
