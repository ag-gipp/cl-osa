What then can we conclude about war and film before the First World War? Firstly, that many practices relating to filming war were established within this period: cameramen learned the sheer difficulty of capturing war on film, and producers discovered how to reconstruct action when they couldnâ€™t get the real thing. Secondly, the authorities learned to exercise rigorous control both over the cameramen and over the cinemas where the films were shown. Thirdly, governments learned the value of film as propaganda.
