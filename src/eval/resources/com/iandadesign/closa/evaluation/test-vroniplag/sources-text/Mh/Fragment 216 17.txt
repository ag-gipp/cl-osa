Market equilibrium requires that aggregate demand equals fixed supply normalized to 1, yielding the equilibrium price $ P_t = \frac{1}{1+r} \left[ r + E_t p_{t+1} - 2 \gamma ({}_t \sigma^2_{p_{t+1}} + \sigma^2_\epsilon ) + \mu\rho_t \right]. (17) $ De Long et al. (1990a) only consider steady state equilibria satisfying the pricing rule $ P_t = 1+\frac{\mu\rho^*}{r} + \frac{\mu(\rho_t-\rho^*)}{1+r}-\frac{2\gamma}{r} [ \sigma^2_\epsilon+\frac{\mu^2\sigma^2_\rho}{(1+r)^2} ]. (18) $ [...] Notice that, when the distribution of the misperception $ \rho_t $ of the noise traders converges to a point mass at $ \rho^*=0 $, the price of the risky asset converges to its fundamental value $ 1 - ( 2\gamma\sigma^2_\epsilon/r ) $. [...] An important question is which type of traders, sophisticated or noise traders, earn relative higher returns. DeLong et al. (1990a) compute the (unconditional) expected difference of return between noise traders and sophisticated traders to be $ E[\Delta R_t]=\rho^*-\frac{(\rho^*)^2+\sigma^2_\rho}{2\gamma\left[\frac{\mu\sigma^2_\rho}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{\sigma^2_\epsilon}{\mu} \right]}. (19) $ From this expression it follows that for the noise traders to earn higher expected returns. the mean misperception $ \rho^* $ of returns must be positive. It is also clear, due to the dominating [ [S. 217] quadratic term in $ \rho^* $, that for high values of $ \rho^* $ the expected difference in returns will become negative. However, for intermediate degrees of average bullishness $ \rho^* $ noise traders earn higher expected returns than sophisticated traders. Furthermore, the larger is the value of $ \gamma $, that is, the more risk averse traders are, the larger is the range of $ \rho^* $-values for which noise traders earn higher expected returns. Imitation of beliefs The arguments above show that when the fractions of both types are fixed, noise traders may earn higher expected returns suggesting that they may be able to survive in the long run. DeLong et al. (1990a) also discuss a dynamic version of the model with time varying fractions. Strategy selection is based upon the relative performance of the two strategies. Letting $ \mu_t $ be the fraction of noise traders and $ R^N_t $ and $ R^S_t $ be the realized return of noise traders and sophisticated traders, the fraction of noise traders changes according to $ \mu_{t+1} = \max\{0, \min [1,\mu_t + \alpha (R^N_t - R^S_t) ]\} (20) $ where $ \alpha > 0 $ is the rate at which investors become noise traders.
