When Denmark, the Republic of Ireland, and the United Kingdom signed the Treaty of Accession in 1972 they were required to take appropriate steps to accommodate Community law within their legal systems. In the case of Denmark and Ireland formal constitutional amendments were necessary. This course of action was not open to the United Kingdom, but it was essential that Parliament should authorize the reception of Community law and should empower British courts to administer Community law. The force of law within the United Kingdom had to be given not only to existing but also to future rules of Community law. Given these objectives, the sovereignty of Parliament was 'at once an advantage and a source of difficulty'.51 The advantage was that no formal constitutional amendment was necessary. It took only a few lines in an Act of Parliament to receive within the United Kingdom a massive body of Community law and to equip the British government with additional powers to handle Community affairs. In vain did anti-Marketeers in Parliament complain that the provisions of the European Communities Act 1972 were an unjustifiable and illegitimate departure from British constitutional tradition. The difficulty came in so far as the future was concerned: could any constitutional guarantee be give, nor an undertaking entrenched that Parliament would not at some future date either legislate to leave the Community or (whether inadvertently or intentionally) legislate in a manner which conflicted with Community law? The view taken by the government in 1972 was that no absolute legislative undertaking by Parliament should be given, since a future Parliament could disregard such an undertaking. [...] Instead, the accession legislation went as far as was thought possible in instructing British courts how to apply Community law in the future. 51 Warner, 'European Community Law and National Laws', 364.
