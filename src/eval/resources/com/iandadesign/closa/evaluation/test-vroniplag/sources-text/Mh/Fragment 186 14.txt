There are two defining characteristics of the subsumption architecture. The first is that an agent's decision-making is realized through a set of task-accomplishing behaviours; [...]. Each of these behaviour modules is intended to achieve some particular task. In Brooks implementation, the behaviour modules are finite-state machines. [...] these behaviours are implemented as rules of the form situation -> action, which simply map perceptual input directly to actions. The second defining characteristic of the subsumption architecture is that many behaviors can 'fire' simultaneously. There must obviously be a mechanism to choose between the different actions selected by these multiple actions. Brooks proposed rearranging the modules into a subsumption hierarchy, with the [behaviors arranged into layers.]
