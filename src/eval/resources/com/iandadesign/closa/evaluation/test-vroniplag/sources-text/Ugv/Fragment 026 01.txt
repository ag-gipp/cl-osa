[Seite 382] A much more plausible explanation is suggested by the studies of Connell and Connell7 and Schumacher.11 These studies found an increased incidence in detection of C-reactive protein in women using contraceptive pills that contain estrogens and progestogens, as compared to the control group. It is probable that C-reactive protein reflects rising estrogen levels and, to a lesser degree, progestational agents. [...] Another possible link to elevated C-reactive protein could be the rise in prostaglandins during labor.14 In animal and human studies, prostaglandins were reported to stimulate an increase in acute-phase serum proteins.15,16 [Literaturnachweise Seite 383] 7.
