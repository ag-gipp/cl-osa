The worst disturbance arose in 1870, and this was occasioned by a political crisis rather than by economic/financial problems. The 1870 Franco-Prussian War led to an increased demand for financial accommodation in the form of discounts at the National Bank. The natural nervousness, obviously shared by the politicians, was then worsened by acts by the Ministry of Finance, which required the transfer of the specie reserve from Brussels to Antwerp, and the Ministry of War, which gave instructions to its agents to exchange its existing holding of Bank notes into specie.
