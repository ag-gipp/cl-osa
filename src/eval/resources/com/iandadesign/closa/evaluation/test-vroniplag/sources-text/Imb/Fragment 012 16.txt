B.1.4 Virulence factors and virulence-associated factors Virulence - per definition â€“ is the capability of a pathogen to cause disease. Virulence factors are defined as bacterial products that aid growth or survival of a bacterium in the host, thereby contributing to infection and disease (MAHAN et al. 1996; MEKALANOS 1992). Proteins, which are involved in both metabolism and virulence are designated as virulence-associated factors. B.1.4.1 Fimbriae, LPS and capsule Colonisation, i.e. the ability of a pathogen to adhere to the host cell surfaces and to multiply within the host, is often a prerequisite for the production of disease. The role of fimbriae for adherence has been well defined for a wide variety of pathogens (SAUER et al. 2000). MAHAN, M. J., J. M. SLAUCH a. J. J.
