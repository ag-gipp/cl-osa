Description of studies Fifty-eight articles were identified in the literature search. Of these, 41 studies did not meet the inclusion criteria and three studies (Nielsen 1990a, Williams-Russo 1992, D'Ambrosio 1998) were duplicate publications. One study (Lopes 1999) was unavailable through our library or inter-library loans. The details of the 44 excluded studies are described in the "Characteristics of excluded studies" table. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Inter-rater reliability for the study selection was 0.46. The thirteen included studies varied extensively in the intraoperative co-interventions. Spinal anaesthesia, epidural anaesthesia, general anaesthesia, and epigeneral anaesthesia was used for all groups in three, two, one, and two studies respectively. Three studies compared epidural anaesthesia and analgesia with general anaesthesia and systemic analgesia. Two studies compared epigeneral anaesthesia and epidural analgesia with general anaesthesia and systemic analgesia. Four studies evaluated patients undergoing total hip replacement, six studies evaluated patients undergoing total knee replacement, and three studies evaluated patients undergoing either types of joint replacement.
