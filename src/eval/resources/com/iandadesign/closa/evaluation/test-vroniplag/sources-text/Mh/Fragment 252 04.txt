Another very common and pertinent criticism is that most agent-based financial market models assume a small number of assets. Often agents trade only one risky asset and one risk-free asset alone. [FN 55] [...] Almost all of the agents that are modeled and discussed in this survey operate inductively. They adopt rules and forecasts which have performed well in the recent past, and they adjust these rules and forecasts to perfom better in the future. The early spirit of agent-based models is clearly to push away from more traditional deductive styles of learning and towards inductive styles of learning. [...] Can they be allowed to do some form of deductive reasoning? Can they learn commonly held theories in finance, such as present value analysis, or the Black-Scholes option pricing formula? An interesting question is whether an agent-based model can be constructed that allows for a little deductive reasoning while keeping the general inductive spirit of simple rules of thumb. [FN 55] Two recent exceptions to this are Chiarella et al. (2004) and Westerhoff (2004). Also, Levy et al. (2000) perform some experiments in multi-asset settings with options.
