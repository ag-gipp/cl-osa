Germany relative to 18 European countries in 1980 and latest available year (19911993) [Seite 12] a decrease in the standardized death rates (SDRs) in men and women aged 064 years for CVDs in general as well as for ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. However, in spite of these decreases, Germanys position worsened compared to the reference countries as to mortality from these causes; more or less stable death rates for overall cancer mortality in people aged 0-64 years, a strong increase of the female SDR for cancer of the lung, some increase of female breast cancer, and some improvement as regards cervical cancer mortality in the same age group. Measures relating to the health of the total population often hide important differences between segments of that population. In general, women have higher morbidity but lower death rates than men. As a result, in 1993 women's life expectancy at birth in Germany (79.4 years) was 6.7 years longer than men's (72.7 years). Differences can also be observed between regions. In the new Länder, for instance, life expectancy was roughly three years lower for men and two years lower for women in 1993. Social class differences have also been shown to have a major impact on health outcomes: in the group aged 30-59 years the death rate more than doubles from the highest to the lowest income groups (Mielck 1994).
