In a detailed examination of the social and psychological factors responsible for drinking behaviors among young girls, Coombs and colleagues (1985) interviewed 197 girls ages 9-17 who lived in the Los Angeles area. Investigators were particularly interested in why these young girls chose to abuse drugs and alcohol. Four hypotheses were tested: (1) deprivation (i.e., broken homes and economic hardship), (2) personal deficiency (i.e., lack of emotional maturity or having specific character traits that promote unhealthy behaviors), (3) youth culture (i.e., the belief that everybody's doing it), and (4) family pathology (i.e., detrimental interactions between family members or lack of parental rewards, role modeling, belief systems, or controls). Surprisingly, the results indicated thal deprivation (family breakup or low-income status) wras not significantly related to alcohol use in this sample. There was stronger evidence that youth culture played a role in promoting drinking behavior.
