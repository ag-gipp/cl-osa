B.1.4.5 Other factors The enzyme urease is commonly found in A. pleuropneumoniae clinical isolates, although one spontaneously urease-negative strain could be isolated (BLANCHARD et al. 1993). The enzyme catalyses the hydrolysis of urea to produce ammonia and carbon dioxide. Ammonia is a preferred nitrogen source for many bacteria and can increase the pH, thereby producing a favorable environment for multiplication. The urease seems to contribute to the ability of A. pleuropneumoniae to establish infection and subsequently cause disease, but its full relevance is not clear. A urease deficient mutant strain is not able to establish disease at low dose challenge (BOSSE a. MACINNES 2000), but at high dose challenge no differences were observed between the mutant strain and the parent strain (BALTES et al. 2001; TASCON CABRERO et al. 1997). Further virulence factors include a protease, which cleaves secreted porcine IgA, thereby possibly facilitating colonization of the lower respiratory tract (KILIAN et al. 1979; NEGRETE-ABASCAL et al. 1994), and a Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase which protects A. pleuropneumoniae from reactive oxygen radicals in vitro, but is not required for virulence (LANGFORD et al. 1996; SHEEHAN et al. 2000). Several further factors potentially involved in virulence were identified using signature-tagged mutagenesis (SHEEHAN et al. 2003). BALTES, N., W. TONPITAK, G.-F. GERLACH, I. HENNIG-PAUKA, A.
