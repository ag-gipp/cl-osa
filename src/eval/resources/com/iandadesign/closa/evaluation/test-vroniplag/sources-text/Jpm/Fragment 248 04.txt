Nonlocal healing methods typically involve agents who pray for or send positive mental thoughts toward subjects who are located at a distance; agents who are praying for subjects typically don’t know* the subjects, and subjects don’t know’ that they are being prayed for by agents. The mechanism of effect is unknown. Miller (1982) conducted a doubleblind study in which eight “healers” used remote mental healing in attempt to treat 96 hypertensive patients ages 16-60. The healing treatment used by healers involved (a) a relaxation step, (b) attunement with a higher power or infinite being, (c) visualization and/or affirmation of the patient in a state of perfect health, and (d) expression of thanks to God or to the source of all power and energy. Neither doctors nor subjects knew which patients received the mental healing treatments. Normal medical treatment was continued in all cases, and improvement was judged by changes in the diastolic and systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and weight. The subjects in the healer-treated group showed significant improvement in systolic blood pressure compared to the control group, but there was no significant difference in change in diastolic blood pressure, pulse, or weight between the groups. Interestingly, four of the healers achieved a 92.3% improvement rate in their total group of patients, compared with a 73.7% improvement in the control group. In a later double-bind study of nonlocal healing, Beutler and colleagues (1988) randomly assigned 115 patients with hypertension to receive 15 wreeks of paranormal healing by laying on of hands (n = 40), paranormal healing at a distance (n = 37), or no paranormal healing (n = 38).
