Religious orthodoxy was measured by three items: religious versus secular education, self- definition as orthodox, traditional, or secular, and frequency of synagogue attendance. The most orthodox group experienced a lower mortality rate from CAD (38 vs. 61 per 10,000) and from other causes (135 vs. 168 per 10,000) than did nonbelievers. The risk of death from CAD among the most orthodox believers during the 23-year follow-up was 20% lower than that for less orthodox Jew s or nonbelievers (see Figure 16.1). These results remained significant after the researchers controlled for age, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, body mass index, and baseline CAD.
