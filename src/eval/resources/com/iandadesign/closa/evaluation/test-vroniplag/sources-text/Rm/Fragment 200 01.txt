In this sense the ultimate sovereignty of Westminster was not affected, as ministers admitted, even though they refused to allow a statement to this effect to be included in the Act.54 But there was for many years uncertainty about a less extreme situation, should an Act passed after 1972 be found to contain a provision inconsistent with an established rule of Community law. In this situation, we have already seen that the European Court will insist that Community law must prevail. But should the British courts take up the same position (as section 3 of the 1972 Act would indicate is their duty55), or does the later Act of Parliament override the 1972 Act, including sections 2 and 3, to the extent of requiring the conflict to be resolved from a British standpoint?56 In Parliament in 1972, ministers emphasized that section 2 (4) contained what was essentially a rule of construction, so that if an apparent conflict arose between a later Act and Community law, the British courts were if at all possible to construe the Act in such a way as to achieve consistency rather than conflict. Lord Colville said, 'It is, only if they cannot do so that the law of the English courts allows them to give precedence to the later English Act.'57 Speaking in the same debate, the judge, Lord Diplock, said, 'This clause is designed to ensure that the courts, when they are construing that subsequent Act of Parliament, will recognise that it was the intention of Parliament not to conflict with the Community law.'58 But, said Lord Diplock, when a conflict could not be resolved by construction, the courts would be bound to give effect to the subsequent Act of Parliament. The case-law under the 1972 Act did not at first speak with a certain voice. Initially the British judges were inclined to avoid finding clashes and inconsistencies between the domestic law and Community law. In 1974, Lord Denning MR said that the incoming tide of Community law could not be held back. 54 HC Deb., 5 July 1972, cols. 556-644. 55 See Mitchell, 'Sovereignty of Parliament', at 41. 57 HL Deb., 8 Aug. 1972, cols. 1026-7. 58 Ibid., col 1029.
