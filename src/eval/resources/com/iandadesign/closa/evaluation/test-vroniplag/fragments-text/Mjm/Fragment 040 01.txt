[Further, catecholamine can lead to a neutrophil and PMN sequestration in the lungs (Boogs, 1975; Davis] et al., 1991; Morken et al., 2002). While severe brain traumas lead to centrally activated pulmonary changes, direct pulmonary impairments, shock and polytrauma can lead to a circumferentially reinforced lung failure. Finally an arterial hypoxaemia as well as hyperkapnaemia occur and a drastic increase in the cerebral blood circulation must be anticipated (Singbartl, 1981). In this research most animals in all three trial groups showed a low degree of pulmonary edema as well as a low degree infiltration with PMN. The immigration of PMN in the lung tissue in connection with the emergence of pulmonary edema in animal-experimental hemorrhagic or traumatic brain injury models is also described in the literature (Abraham et al., 2000; Yildrim et al., 2004). A similar pathophysiological mechanism to the lungs is to be found in other visceral organs. Moreover a hyperdynamic period, which is called upon after a traumatic brain injury, is followed by a hypodynamic condition associated with a hypoperfusion of various organs (Yuan et al., 1990).
