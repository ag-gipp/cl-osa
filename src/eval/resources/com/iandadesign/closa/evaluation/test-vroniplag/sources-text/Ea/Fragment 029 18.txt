In addition, in children with recurrent events, data on the time to recurrence, VTE type and location of recurrence, associated clinical risk factors, and duration and type of anticoagulation110 were required. Case reports and case series/studies in which <50% of cases were systematically screened for IT, publications reporting asymptomatic thrombosis, and studies with unclear laboratory/analytical methodology to differentiate between inherited and acquired deficiency states of protein C, protein S, or antithrombin were not included (except in instances when this distinction was subsequently clarified in personal communication with the responsible authors; only cases with inherited deficiency states were included in the analyses).
