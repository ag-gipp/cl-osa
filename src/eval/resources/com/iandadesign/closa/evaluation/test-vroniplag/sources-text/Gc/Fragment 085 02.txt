A number of agreements have given an added impetus to these trends, notably within the WTO, through the GATT, GATS and TRIPS agreements, which will continue to play an important role in promoting trade liberalisation, including the recent agreement on telecommunication services. One of the major obstacles for the development of advanced communication services which are at the basis of the "online" economy are high telecommunications costs. Dramatic reductions in the cost of computing power together with competition are pushing tariffs and giving rise to a global infrastructure where distance becomes meaningless. The Irrelevance of Distance A transatlantic telephone call now costs just 1.5 percent of what it cost 60 years ago. And the World Bank predicts that by 2010 the cost will have fallen by another two-thirds, making for instance trans-Atlantic telecommunications increasingly affordable to all. This will allow small businesses and individuals to establish remote presence, beyond the geo-political borders of their physical location. Doing global business is already no longer limited to big multi-national companies but within reach of everyone who, for instance by using the Internet, is able to set up a global business at low costs.
