The terms “catheter-related,” “central-line-related,” and “recurrence” or “recurrent” also were included in the search strategy. In addition, reference lists of journal articles identified through the aforementioned search were searched manually to locate additional studies. The search strategy had no language restrictions. Citations were screened and classified into cohort/case-control, case series, or registry data by 2 independent group members (L.B. and H.v.O.). Those meeting the inclusion criteria were retained. The decision to include or exclude studies was hierarchical, made initially on the basis of the study title, followed by the abstract, and finally the complete body text. In the event of conflicting opinions, resolution was achieved though discussion (L.B., F.F., N.G., J.J., G.K., A.K., M.M.-J., U.N.G., H.v.O., and P.S.).
