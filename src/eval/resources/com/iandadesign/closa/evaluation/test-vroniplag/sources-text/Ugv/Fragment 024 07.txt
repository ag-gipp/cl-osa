[Seite 456, Z. 2-4] Many of the changes suggest diminished immunologic competence, and some are compatible with an increased responsiveness to foreign antigens. [Seite 455, Z. 26] A decline in immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels during pregnancy [Seite 456, Z. 1, 11-20] has been noted (30). [...] [...] In addition to being more numerous, a number of studies have suggested increased polymorphonuclear activity during pregnancy. One measure of white blood cell function is the ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to ingest a colorless dye, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), and reduce it to a recognizable dark substance within the cell. The numbers of dye-positive cells are recorded as a percentage of the total number counted. This percentage is increased in normal patients during pregnancy (Fig. 2) (26). This enhanced response seems further evident in the studies of Mitchell et al. who found that peripheral leukocytes of pregnant women had greater phagocytic and bactericidal activity than white blood cells from nonpregnant women (32). [Seite 456, Z. 4-6] [For example, there are diminished numbers of some lymphocytes (38),] and there is a decreased immunologic reaction of lymphocytes (17). [Literaturverzeichnis Seite 474] 17.
