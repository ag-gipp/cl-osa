Besides these genres, Nordisk in particular produced some ambitious projects such as war films, peace films, science fiction films and, towards the end of the war, films about social development. [...] In 1914 Nordisk obtained permission from the German Army to make reportage films from the front. The result was seven films, called KRIGSBILLEDER (‘War Pictures’). Each film was 100-200m long.
