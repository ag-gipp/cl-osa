Letting $ \mu_t $ be the fraction of noise traders and $ R^N_t $ and $ R^R_t $ be the realized return of noise traders and sophisticated traders, the fraction of noise traders changes according to $ \mu_{t+1} = \max\{0, \min [1,\mu_t + \alpha (R^N_t - R^R_t) ]\} $ where $ \alpha > 0 $ is the rate at which investors become noise traders. [...] It should be noted that this HAM [...] can only be solved for small values of $ \alpha $, because sophisticated agents have to calculate the effect of the realization of returns on the fractions of noise traders and sophisticated traders in the next period. For $ \alpha $ sufficiently small realized returns can be calculated under the approximation that the fraction of noise traders remains the same. [...] A straightforward computation shows that the number of steady states $ \mu^* $ depends upon the parameter condition $ \sigma^2_\epsilon > \frac{(1+r)^2(\rho^* + \sigma^2_\rho)^2}{16\gamma^2(\rho^*)^2\sigma^2_\rho} \quad\quad (23) $ The dynamics of the fraction of noise traders, in the limit as the speed of adjustment $ \alpha $ tends to 0, has the following properties: If (23) is satisfied, then there are no steady states $ \mu^* $ satisfying (22); noise traders always earn higher expected return and drive out sophisticated rational traders, that is, the noise trader share $ \mu_t $ tends to 1; If (23) is not satisfied, then (22) has (at least one) positive real root(s); the smallest $ \mu^*_L>0 $ is stable and thus a positive share of noise traders always survives in the market; if $ \mu_L\ge 1 $, then noise traders drive out sophisticated rational traders.
