Lettau (1997) provides a good example of a computational model of this type. He implements a financial market model with a set of heterogeneous learning agents, that is simple, transparent, and easy to implement. The model is a portfolio choice environment where investors must decide what fraction of wealth to put in a risky asset. There is also a risk-free asset paying zero interest. The world is a repeated two-period model with myopic preferences based only on wealth in the second period. The risky asset has an exogenously given price and pays a random dividend, d, which follows a normal distribution. The second period wealth of agent is given by, $ w = s(d-p), $(2) and their preferences are assumed to exhibit constant absolute risk aversion which can be parameterized as in, $ U(w) = -e^{-\gamma w}. $(3)
