[S. 103, 13-19] On 5 April 1991 the Security Council adopted Resolution 688 in which the Council declared itself gravely concerned by the repression of the Iraqi civilian population in many parts of Iraq, including most recently in Kurdish populated areas which led to a "massive flow of refugees towards and across international frontiers and to cross border incursions threatening international peace and security in the region." [S. 104, 3-22] The resolution is not formally based on Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. While it uses the wording of Article 39 it does not [...] mention either Chapter VII or any of the articles of that Chapter. [...] On the basis of this resolution the Secretary-General sent a representative to Baghdad who negotiated a memorandum of understanding [...] to have a humanitarian presence in Iraq organized by the United Nations[FN 17]. [...] However, exactly one day before the original memorandum had been concluded, on 17 April 1991 the United States, the United Kingdom and France had already begun to move armed forces into northern Iraq from Turkey with the declared aim of setting up camps to secure the safety of Kurdish refugees and of coordinating relief supplies. Under the name "Operation Provide Comfort" the allied intervention force established a triangular zone at the border in the north of Iraq. [S. 105, 1-4] The occupation of almost 10 OOO square kilometres of Iraqi territory [...] lasted about three months. [S. 105, 23-28 u. S. 106, 1-8] In this context the allied powers also proclaimed flight prohibition zones for Iraqi military aircraft in the northern and southern areas of Iraq. In April 1991 military actions by Iraq north of the 36th parallel, particularly by aircraft, were prohibited by the United States[FN 24]. An air exclusion zone in southern Iraq was officially proclaimed on 26 August [Seite 106] 1992 by France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States[FN 25]. In December 1992, United States fighters shot down an Iraqi airforce plane which had crossed into the southern zone[FN 26]. In January 1993, United States, British and French planes attacked Iraqi anti-aircraft missile launch sites in the southern zone as well as installations near Baghdad. [...] The justification given for this action was that Iraq had not complied with the United Nations resolutions.
