Since the sovereign debt crisis descended on Europe in spring 2010, the nightmare haunting the continent's policymakers has been the prospect of the crisis reaching Italy.
In recent weeks the odds of such an event happening have shortened dramatically.
If Rome is to stave it off, urgent and decisive action is needed.
Having eased a little following Monday's panic, yields on Italian bonds rose again on Thursday.
Italy was forced to pay 4.93 per cent – the highest for three years, and a percentage point more than a month ago – to sell five-year paper.
A simultaneous auction of 15-year debt was the most expensive on record.
The Italian state can cope for a time with the pain of expensive auctions.
The maturity profile of its debt is favourable and the cost of higher yields would only become dangerous if sustained over a prolonged period.
But any doubts about Italy's debt sustainability could impair the ability of Italian banks to fund themselves.
That could be felt much sooner.
Once yields balloon, a loss of confidence can quickly become self- fulfilling.
As the experience of Ireland shows, once a country loses the faith of the market, it is almost impossible to regain.
To avoid such an outcome, Italy's leaders must act boldly and swiftly.
Monday's panic concentrated minds and the austerity packaged proposed by Giulio Tremonti, finance minister, is being fast-tracked through parliament.
The programme is far from perfect.
It envisages €45bn of fiscal tightening – yet measures worth €15bn will require secondary legislation.
The bulk of the remaining squeeze will not occur until after the next general election in 2013.
And the plan does little to boost Italy's anaemic growth rate.
With markets on edge, Italy's parliament must pass Mr Tremonti's package without delay. The government must then propose the secondary legislation needed to implement it as soon as possible.
Given that the implementation may well spill over into the next parliament, it is crucial that the opposition backs the measures too.
However, to convince markets that it is credible, Italy needs more than austerity.
Rome needs to send a clear message of intent.
Ideally, this would be the removal of Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister, and his replacement by a broadly based government led by technocrats.
Mr Berlusconi's attempt last weekend to insert into the austerity package a measure that would have allowed a company he owns to defer a €560m fine was beyond reckless.
His willingness to risk his country's fiscal credibility to protect his personal wealth was beneath contempt.
If, as seems likely, engineering Mr Berlusconi's exit is beyond Italy's political classes, they must find other ways of demonstrating their resolve.
The best approach would be to supplement Mr Tremonti's austerity drive with a programme of radical structural reforms designed to raise Italy‘s long-run growth rate.
An obvious place to start is the the lack of competition across a number of Italian professions.
These must be liberalised.
Sadly, an attempt to reform the legal profession this week foundered on the self-interest of lawyers in the Italian parliament.
But the approach was the right one and should be replicated.
Second, Italy's two-tier labour market, which impairs Italian productivity, must be reformed.
Third, the lumbering legal system, which imposes huge costs on the companies that use it, must be overhauled.
It is a disgrace that Mr Berlusconi's efforts in this direction have been almost entirely designed to protect his own complicated interests.
Structural reforms will inevitably take time to have an effect, and will not be popular.
But if Italy is to restore the market's confidence, they are indispensable.
