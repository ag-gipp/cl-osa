The ink on the eurozone's newest comprehensive plan was barely dry when Klaus Regling, head of the currency bloc's rescue fund, darted off to Beijing to tap its coffers of sovereign wealth.
A fund manager must go wherever the potential investors are.
But wise European politicians will treat his efforts with benign neglect.
Too few leaders appreciate the significance of one simple but fundamental fact: the eurozone is in external balance. It imports about as much as it exports and as much money enters the bloc as departs it.
The crisis is not one of external financing for the monetary union as a whole.
It is one of internal asymmetries between surplus and deficit member countries and between the public and private sectors in all of them.
The European financial stability facility's purpose is to match these asymmetries.
On the back of guarantees by stronger member states, it will raise private funding and channel it to governments struggling to finance themselves in the market.
For the EFSF itself, there is no reason not to approach China as a potential investor.
But the monetary union itself has no need for China's savings and good reasons to stay away from them.
The most obvious is political.
Beijing will exact a price proportional to the desperation exuded by Europeans.
Even if being a creditor is a source of dependence as well as domination – as China's inability to extricate itself from US investments shows – Europe may still have to swallow a quid pro quo, such as lowering the volume of its criticism of China's currency policy or human rights abuses.
That would be a steep price to pay even for something economically indispensable.
It is worse when the economic benefit is illusory.
If a Chinese investment is a net capital inflow, a stronger euro will worsen the eurozone's trade performance.
If it is offset by private outflows, China simply substitutes for financing that could have been provided by European savers.
Neither does the eurozone any good – unless, of course, EFSF investments are so risky that Europeans would rather have China bear the risk.
That is surely not what the eurozone's leaders should be trying to signal.
In any case Beijing's nervousness about being treated as a source of dumb money suggests Mr Regling's pitch will have limited results.
The less talk of Chinese money, the better.
If your problem is one of credibility, the worst thing you can do is draw attention to an initiative doomed to be either unproductive or counter-productive.
