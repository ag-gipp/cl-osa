The European Commission has put forward surprisingly daring proposals to reform the auditing industry.
The Big Four firms may cavil.
But advocates of a more robust and independent approach to the business of financial audits will offer two cheers.
Michel Barnier, Europe's internal market commissioner, is right to say there is an urgent need to restore trust in the accounting profession in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
Measures such as imposing a nine-year limit on auditors to a single company, and requiring joint audits for certain clients go some way to creating checks and balances.
Critics who claim that joint audits merely push up cost or allow each auditor to shift responsibility should be dismissed.
France has long had a joint audit system.
Studies have shown that, on average, costs of joint audits go up by about 10 per cent â€“ surely an acceptable price for a higher quality service.
As for the second criticism regulators can demand joint and several responsibility which easily overcomes the problem of where to lay the blame.
Mr Barnier's most radical proposal to ban accountancy firms from offering consulting services is also appealing.
Good auditing is, after all a vital public interest.
Why should this be exposed to the risk of manipulation to serve the interests of more lucrative consulting?
To be fair, the vast majority of consultancy revenue for the top four firms comes from non-audit clients.
Thus an outright ban may be overly radical.
But it would be reasonable to demand that accountancy firms spin off their consultancy businesses into companies separate from their auditing arms, as some European countries already require.
Mr Barnier's proposal has one fundamental flaw.
He has failed to address the single greatest challenge: how to encourage new firms to enter the auditing market, to promote more competition and thus greater security of audit services.
Five years ago US authorities stopped short of pulling the plug on one big firm suspected of wrongdoing.
They held off for fear of the consequences should one of the big four disappear.
Encouraging new entrants should be a priority.
But European rules requiring qualified auditors to control auditing firms make it almost impossible to find sizeable third party funding for new ventures.
Opening up the ownership of auditing firms would be the most effective and daring reform Mr Barnier could propose.
