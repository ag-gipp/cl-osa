The financial crisis is over; yet a durable recovery is not yet in place.
Unprecedented support for the financial sector, along with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, has allowed the world economy to emerge from the crisis.
This has been true not only in the high-income countries but also in China.
The question is how to withdraw that stimulus and so rely on renewed private demand.
It is neither likely nor desirable that much of the recovery in private demand will come from the US or other erstwhile deficit country.
That could only happen with a renewed surge in private borrowing.
But in the US, UK and similarly affected countries, the task is to deleverage the private sector, not increase indebtedness further.
The private sector will need to reduce its liabilities by spending less than its income over a sustained period.
The question is what might offset such frugality.
In the short to medium term, we already know the answer: public sector borrowing.
On the basis of forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the US government will run a general fiscal deficit of about 11 per cent of gross domestic product this year, while the current account deficit will be about 3 per cent of GDP.
By definition, this means that the private sector is running a financial surplus of 8 per cent of GDP.
This is a massive swing from 2007, when the US private sector ran a deficit of 2.4 per cent of GDP.
Assume, moderately, that the US private sector will want to run an excess of income over spending of just 3 per cent of GDP after the crisis is over. Assume, too, as the OECD forecasts, that the current account deficit rises towards 4 per cent of GDP, by 2011.
Then the general government deficit would still be 7 per cent of GDP.
The big point is that if there is to be deleveraging of the private sector and a huge reduction in the fiscal deficit, then the current account deficit must pretty well disappear.
Many argue that the global ""imbalances"" helped cause the crisis.
This remains controversial.
But a durable recovery does demand global rebalancing.
In its absence, there will either be a prolonged global recession, or a renewed bout of borrowing by already overindebted private sectors or gigantic and ultimately unsustainable fiscal deficits.
The question, then, is how to achieve durable rebalancing, in terms of who acts and how.
On the who, much attention has been focused on China, the world's biggest surplus country.
But, as Kemal Dervis, former minister of the UN Development Programme, argued in the FT this week, emerging and developing economies, apart from China, should be encouraged to borrow more, too.
To achieve this, the world will need to promote substantial institutional reforms, including greater insurance against risk of crises, via expanded resources for the International Monetary Fund.
Nevertheless, China and other surplus countries must play their part.
Indeed, it surely makes sense for China to shift from a target for growth of output to one for growth in domestic demand at above the potential growth of supply.
Finally, there is the question of ""how"" to make the needed shifts.
The big debate is over the role of exchange rate changes.
It would be possible to ignore exchange rates.
But that would surely mean a danger of inflationary excess demand in surplus countries and deficient demand in deficit ones.
The exchange rate changes are needed, to facilitate global adjustment.
China is too important to continue with its present policy of pegging the renminbi to the dollar.
Its exchange rate is a legitimate subject of common concern.
The needed global adjustment will be thwarted if the pegging continues.
That may seem unfair to the Chinese.
But it is the price of having become a huge economic power.
