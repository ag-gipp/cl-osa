It is hypothesis week on Capitol Hill.
Yesterday, Paul Ryan, the House budget chairman, published a Republican plan he claims would restore the US deficit to balance within a decade.
Today, Senate Democrats will offer their own plan to put the US on a fiscally sustainable course.
Both have merits – although Mr Ryan's is based on some unrealistic assumptions.
But since neither stands a chance of being enacted, they are chiefly an exercise in showmanship.
It is time for President Barack Obama to inject some ambition into the sterile US fiscal debate.
There is still scope for him to go for a grand bargain in 2013.
There are two compelling reasons for Mr Obama to seize the initiative.
The first is tactical.
Aiming for a big fiscal overhaul based on lifting US competitiveness would help break today's dismal tactical impasse.
Most people had assumed the $85bn sequestration that Congress allowed to come into effect on March 1 would only survive a few weeks.
Now it is likely to be wrapped into the resolutions that Congress will have to pass by March 27 to prevent a government shutdown.
There may be tweaks to allow agencies more scope over how the sequestration cuts are applied.
These will only start to be felt in April.
But the decision to shave up to 0.6 percentage points off this year's US growth looks likely to stay.
Of far greater concern is the danger that Congress is drifting into another debt ceiling showdown.
Neither party looks likely to retreat from its entrenched fiscal position before the US hits that point in July or August.
Republicans continue to rule out any revenue increases.
And Democrats will not budge on entitlement reform unless Republicans agree to close tax loopholes.
Without a broader initiative – one offering lawmakers the prize of boosting US competitiveness rather than the penalty of owning US austerity – it is hard to see how that drift will be stopped.
The second reason is substantive.
Even if Congress startled everyone by passing a budget this year, it would be agreed on the basis of the existing tax and benefits system.
This is where the debate should be.
The US tax code, a lawyer's paradise and an entrepreneur's hell, rewards leverage over equity and prefers consumption to investment.
Meanwhile, rising retiree costs threaten long-term fiscal doom and a shrinking budget for working-age Americans.
The big picture is staring lawmakers in the face.
It is a president's job to make them see it.
