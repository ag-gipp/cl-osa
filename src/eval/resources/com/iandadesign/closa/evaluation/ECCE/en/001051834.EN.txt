Intelligent observers of the epic battles being fought by technology companies in US courtrooms concluded long ago that the country's patent system is no longer fit for its constitutionally enshrined purpose of promoting “the progress of science and useful arts”.
President Barack Obama, who has wielded his veto to lift a ban on importing some Apple products into the US, appears to have some sympathy for the critics, even if such extrajudicial action is unlikely to have been their preferred fix.
The intervention, which reverses the only significant legal defeat that Apple had suffered in the US to its arch-rival Samsung , inevitably aroused suspicions about the president's motives.
The terse rationale offered by Michael Froman, US trade representative, did little to allay those concerns.
This is not the first time that the objectivity of the US patent system has been called into doubt.
In a patent trial against Samsung last year, the sympathies of a Californian jury were widely felt to have handed Apple an advantage.
The impression that the US uses its patent system as an instrument of trade protection threatens to undermine international efforts to enforce intellectual property rights – something the US economy, which earns its jam by developing technology at home and exploiting it overseas, can ill-afford.
Nonetheless, Mr Obama has vetoed a decision that deserved to be reversed.
It concerned a so-called “standard-essential patent” – in this case, for technology that is necessary to make a mobile phone work on a 3G network.
Most of the value in this technology lies not in its inherent advantages but in the fact of its adoption, which prevents the use of incompatible alternatives that are otherwise just as good.
Industry conventions dictate – and, increasingly, antitrust regulators are insisting – that holders of such patents should licence them to all-comers on reasonable, non-discriminatory terms.
The details are contested, but Apple declined Samsung's proposed terms for licensing the technology, which is used in early models of the iPhone and iPad (some of which are still on sale).
Samsung filed suit; if its claims are upheld, the amount that Apple must pay will be decided in a federal court.
That litigation, which should ensure that Samsung gets a fair price for its technology, is not affected by Mr Obama's veto.
But Samsung also took its case to the US International Trade Commission, which exercised its power to ban imports of the offending Apple products.
Had Mr Obama not vetoed this decision, it would have dramatically strengthened Samsung's hand, enabling it to extract far more than the fair price of the industry-standard transmission technology that is directly at issue.
Others would have followed suit: there are hundreds of patents covering the industry standards that a typical gadget must conform to.
Their owners could have demanded pay-offs from manufacturers wishing to sell in the US.
That would have sapped the life from one of America's most inventive industries.
That this outcome was avoided only by presidential diktat is nonetheless embarrassing, and damages America's reputation as a nation of laws.
Having prevented legal malfunction on this occasion, Mr Obama should turn his hand to fixing the design.
He could begin by stripping the ITC of its remit to enforce patents, which duplicates that of the federal courts and has been exercised unwisely.
The bar for patent applications must be raised to block “inventions” that are of questionable novelty or value.
Once issued, patents should be easier to challenge, and courts should no longer defer to the overworked examiners who first granted them.
Mr Obama cannot afford to give the impression that he will act only on patents when large US corporations are on the losing side.
