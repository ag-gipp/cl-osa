The Barclays affair may lack the spice of some recent banking scandals, involving as it does the rather dry “crime” of misreporting interest rates.
But few have shone such an unsparing light on the rotten heart of the financial system.
Behind the technical language, what has been exposed by British and American regulators is nothing less than a long-running confidence trick played on the public for personal and institutional advantage.
Putting that right will take more than a few paltry acts of contrition by Barclays' bosses and a bit of hand-wringing from the authorities.
The bankers involved have betrayed an important public trust – that of keeping an accurate public record of the key market rates that are used to value contracts worth trillions of dollars.
They did so to make money and to conceal from the wider world their true cost of borrowing.
This was market-rigging on a grand scale.
It is hard to think of anything more damning – or more corrosive of the reputation of capitalism.
What is shocking is the casual way in which this con was perpetrated, and how few checks were in place to stop it.
The messages swapped between traders – with their promises to reward fiddled figures with bottles of champagne – breathe an easy sense of entitlement.
They also speak volumes about the rotten culture at Barclays.
Bob Diamond, the bank's chief executive, gave a lecture last year in which he stressed the importance of culture in establishing an ethos of trust and integrity.
“Culture is difficult to define,” he explained, “but for me the evidence of culture is how people behave when no one is watching.”
Well, now we know.
The bank's response has been inadequate.
While it has instigated disciplinary action against some individuals, there has been no proper accounting for what went on.
For instance, the legal settlement does not reveal how high up the bank the abuses went.
This must now be corrected.
Barclays should immediately appoint an independent figure with unfettered access to all the information to investigate the rate-rigging.
The conclusions must then be published without interference.
In the absence of this, the authorities must find another way.
As for Mr Diamond, he may not have been the top boss at the time but as the bank's dominant executive he was clearly responsible for its hard-driving culture.
If he had an ounce of shame, he would immediately step down.
Barclays will not be the last bank to be collared for rate-rigging.
Investigations involve regulators on three continents, who are looking into the behaviour of more than 20 banks involved in rate-setting processes.
This cannot have been an isolated act of wrongdoing.
It looks more like a systemic problem afflicting a broad swath of the industry.
The restoration of public confidence clearly requires changes to the way rates are regulated and computed.
The British Banking Association, a bankers' trade body that has hitherto enjoyed responsibility for the London interbank offered rate, has now asked for this function to be put under an independent regulator.
That is a step in the right direction.
Libor and other key rates should also be based on actual transactions, not the banks' easily fiddled estimates of their own borrowing costs.
It would also help if individual bankers were held more firmly to account for their actions.
In Barclays' case it is astonishing that no senior figure has paid with their job.
It is also absurd that in the UK almost no bankers have been prosecuted for their role in the crisis and its fallout.
The chancellor, George Osborne, told MPs yesterday that the Financial Services Authority did not have the power to prosecute Barclays bankers for their role in mis-setting rates.
This gap must be filled.
But beyond questions about legality there is a bigger worry about the wayward behaviour of the financial sector.
The pursuit of unrealistic returns seems to have entrenched a culture of recklessness.
This is not something that can be fixed by a few rule-tweaks, or by bolstering the capital that banks have to hold.
It is about culture and morality.
If, as now seems likely, many banks were involved in fiddling rates, this raises questions not just about the leadership of one institution but that of the whole industry.
For there to be a real change of heart and expectation, it may therefore be necessary to retire this generation of flawed leaders.
The FT does not endorse banker-bashing for its own sake.
But if the bashing is to stop, the banks themselves must change.
