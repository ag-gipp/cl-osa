When eurozone leaders agreed to a second aid programme for Greece last March, they stressed that financial help was conditional on Athens doing its homework.
Six months later, the government has delivered.
Yet, a stand-off between its currency union partners and the International Monetary Fund over the sustainability of the programme has left Athens waiting for the €44bn loan it was promised.
The delay will do no good and a lot of harm to the Greek economy.
More than half of the payment is destined to recapitalise the banking sector, which is currently kept on life-support by the European Central Bank.
While the banks remain on death row, Greek businesses will be constrained in their ability to invest and help the economy out of a deepening recession.
The political consequences of this week's logjam are just as toxic.
Official lenders are humiliating the government led by Antonis Samaras, the prime minister, who used much of his electoral capital to pass the programme of fiscal consolidation that creditors had requested.
Unless the aid disbursement is approved soon, the wafer-thin majority Mr Samaras enjoys in parliament risks being further eroded.
Adding to Greece's political instability is certainly not in the eurozone's interest.
Of course, ensuring that Athens is paid rapidly will not help put Greece's national debt on a sustainable path.
This is why the IMF is right to insist that the eurozone acknowledges the need for a new restructuring.
Athens' liabilities are projected to reach 192 per cent of national income in 2014.
And since 70 per cent of Greek debt is in the hands of eurozone institutions, any meaningful reduction will require them to share some of the pain.
That is the reality.
The exact mechanics of this new restructuring should, as much as possible, take account of the political constraints facing creditor countries.
Solutions such as extending the maturity structure of existing debt or further cutting the interest rate charged may be easier to sell to the electorate than outright cancellations.
However, the priority must be to ensure that no more restructurings are needed.
All options – including write-offs – should be on the table.
So far, markets have been lenient about this latest display of eurozone inertia.
But as the Greek saga has shown repeatedly, it is much easier to lose the confidence of investors than to restore it.
When political leaders meet again on Monday to discuss Greece's future, they should act decisively to resolve the stand-off.
