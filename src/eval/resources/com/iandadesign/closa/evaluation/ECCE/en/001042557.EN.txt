This new year has started like previous ones – with Iran firmly at the top of the international security agenda.
There has been no let-up in the long-running stand-off between the west and Tehran over the latter's secretive nuclear programme.
Indeed, tensions have been rising and tempers fraying.
On the western side, frustrations about Iran's atomic obfuscation have led to a sharp escalation in sanctions against the Islamic regime.
The US has just enacted a law that would interfere with payments earned by Iran from its own oil exports, while the European Union intends to impose an embargo on oil purchases from Iran at the end of this month.
Given that EU nations account for a fifth of Iranian production, that is a vast hole for Tehran to fill.
Such steps are likely to inflict heavy blows on a tottering Iranian economy, and apply further pressure to a regime that has only recently faced down a bout of internal unrest.
Tehran has responded by turning up the bellicose rhetoric.
As well as trumpeting the test-firing of an anti-ship cruise missile, it has in recent days warned the US not to send an aircraft carrier back into the Gulf, and threatened to close the strait of Hormuz.
These provocations cannot be discounted as pure bluff.
Iran has of late shown itself to be capable of unpredictable acts, such as last year's mystifying plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the US.
But it is hard to believe that Tehran would dare to blockade the strait.
This is a vital international waterway, through which passes 40 per cent of the world's internationally-traded oil.
Iran has not the military resources to maintain a blockade for more than a few days.
Indeed, any attempt to impose one would be a supreme act of military folly.
The west can draw some comfort from Iran's discomfiture, which suggests that pressure on the regime may be beginning to tell.
Alongside the warlike words emanating from Tehran, there are tentative signs of a renewed willingness to re-enter discussions about the nuclear programme.
So long as these are not mere prevarications, they are welcome.
However, the US and its allies should not be complacent.
They should make clear to the Iranian government that any attempt to interfere with international shipping in the Gulf – whether civilian or military – will not be tolerated.
Meanwhile, given the heightened threat to maritime trade, attention should be given to the development of other routes for oil exports from the region, and also the bolstering of strategic petroleum reserves.
Iran may be feeling the pressure but it has yet to legitimise or cease its nuclear activities.
Until it does this, the west must prepare for the worst.
