The decision by Standard &amp; Poor's to downgrade France, together with Austria, by one notch is the moment many have dreaded, especially President Nicolas Sarkozy.
But while it may pull the rug out from under the eurozone's efforts (imperfect as they are) to contain the sovereign debt crisis, it is not the end of the world.
The most likely outcome and the best hope is that it will not make all that much of a difference.
Sovereign credit ratings are per se irrelevant: they reveal no new information and should largely be foregone conclusions.
S&amp;P itself to some extent admits this by publicising a methodology based on the same sensible factors everyone else uses to assess sovereign risk.
If ratings judgments have impact when they deserve none, it is because governments anoint them in that role, through formal regulation and rhetorical fetishism.
In the case of France, the fetishist-in-chief used to be Mr Sarkozy, who long insisted on the sanctity of the French triple A stamp.
He and his government, seeing the way the wind was blowing, have recently tacked back to a feigned indifference.
The one certain loser from a French downgrade is Mr Sarkozy himself: he will look weak at home months from an election, and he will have a weaker hand to play in eurozone negotiations.
Beyond this, the economic effect could be limited.
France is bringing its public finances under control, and a one-notch downgrade by one agency need not add to borrowing costs â€“ as the US discovered in August.
The main casualty could be the triple A status of the European Financial Stability Facility.
But this would be no bad thing.
If the eurozone accepted a double A rating for its rescue fund, it would lift a self-imposed constraint on the funding it can raise for troubled states.
Markets being fragile and fickle, worse outcomes cannot be ruled out.
The psychological jolt could rekindle the panic in the Italian and Spanish bond markets, which this week appeared relatively more benign after the pre-Christmas turbulence.
No doubt the downgrades will only increase official ire at raters and in particular at S&amp;P, which displayed the same undiplomatic timing with its US downgrade.
But there is no good timing in a crisis.
Eurozone governments had best focus on addressing any fallout from raters' action.
That means speeding up implementation of agreed tools that can halt runs on sovereign debts.
The EFSF must be deployed on a larger scale and at a greater speed and its successor prepared swiftly.
Crucially, eurozone governments must stop squabbling.
Mr Sarkozy still has cards to play as a bridge between the core and periphery in the eurozone.
He has also helped drag Germany out of its comfort zone.
Triple A states should be on watch to do more.
