London attacks: Tickets issued to cars left near Borough Market

Traffic wardens slapped tickets on cars which were left abandoned inside a police cordon during the London terror attack.
Penalty charge notices were issued to a number of vehicles left near Borough Market, where several people were stabbed on Saturday.
Enforcement officers were seen putting penalty charge notices on windscreens after some streets reopened earlier.
Transport for London (TfL) said the fines "should never have been issued".
It apologised for the "insensitive mistake" and said the charges, which can be up to Â£130, will be cancelled.

Several vehicles were abandoned in the area when Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba drove into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in Borough Market.
Police have said the death toll from Saturday's attacks has risen to eight, while 29 patients remain in hospital, with 10 in a critical condition.
It is understood there will be wardens on patrol in the area for the rest of the week but no cars left parked within the police cordon will be given tickets.
