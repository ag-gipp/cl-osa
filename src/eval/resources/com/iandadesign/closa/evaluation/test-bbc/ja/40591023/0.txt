Mother and daughter 3 people everyone,hydrocyanic acid therapeutic agent to be administered is actually 青酸中毒 was diagnosed with of the anal not alone. Hydrocyanic acid enters the body and, headache, dizziness, confusion, vomiting, twitching,difficulty in breathing such as symptoms that occur as. Large amount of absorption if the instant death you get. Clinical Toxicology and emergency medicine specialist,Johann・the German doctor,"(hydrocyanic acid gas)the immediate effect is very high(omission) bath and by the amount that is in a matter of seconds to death."and talking. "Oxygen to successfully inhale and human cells to produce energy. But hydrocyanic acid to absorb oxygen, and produce energy from it and not be able to" Andrei didn't take us long to find it,the insulation effect of lower,more inexpensive exterior materials to full・tower I decided to head strong, angry. "That person is my son killed it. Ordinary state so I get out of it. Your child is 7 months, and survived it(slightly) but if that was the state, from the son and he's dead." the husband of my office・Gomez is the BBC"News Night"on the 22nd floor of the house in the bedroom of the flame is reached began at 4 p.m.,Bring your family to escape, the decision said.

Glenn felt the fire in what is hydrocyanic acid gas of the source was still unknown. However, the outer wall of the building was used to form the insulation burning, and hydrocyanic acid gas can know. Glen check・the tower in 2015~2016 years, 1000 million pounds (about 15 billion yen)in the scale of large-scale repairs were carried out. In this case, the outer wall used for the material of the top brass, aluminum between plastic sandwiching a fire resistant, low and out of the flame, the fire spread and the relationship has been the focus of attention. Foam insulation so as to cover the aluminum and plastic of the panel,to improve energy efficiency of buildings, as was expected. "Plastic foam insulation is short, and crude. Therefore, other petrochemical products and about the same by burning", the Central Lancashire University Richard Hull, Professor (Chemistry and fire science)are described. "Nitrogen containing large amounts of for a burning and carbon monoxide, and hydrogen cyanide occur" hydrogen cyanide gas hydrocyanic acid gas only. British rigid urethane foam manufacturers Association(BRUFMA)of Public Relations is, what material is the toxic gas of the origin by,I think I've judged as not to be pointed out. BRUFMA is a great full・tower used in types, including polyurethane insulation materials manufacturers of the industry. "Burning material from the gas which is also poisonous. Almost all of the fire in the most dangerous of carbon monoxide," well, "the source cyanurate (PIR)is dangerous to suggest that there is no evidence. The UK Building Research Institute, fire research station PIR panel building test, it was not using the building, especially when compared to the dangerous smoke and toxic gas increases as a result was not obtained"
