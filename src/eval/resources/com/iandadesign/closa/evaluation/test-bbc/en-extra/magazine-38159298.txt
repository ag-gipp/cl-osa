Welcome to the orgasm lab in Austin, Texas, where doctors study the under-researched and little understood problem of sexual dysfunction among women. "Any sexual problem in women is given less importance than any sexual dysfunction in men," says one expert. "I think that there's clearly a double standard... Women are stigmatised if they have any dysfunction. They are told it's in their head."

Darryl Jones has been playing bass with The Rolling Stones for more than two decades but he never appears in official band photographs. Has Jones ever had discussions about becoming a full member? "It has not really come up very often," he says. "I would not be being completely honest if I said that it would not be wonderful. But that is not a decision I am in a position to make." As the Stones prepare to release an album paying homage to the black blues musicians who inspired them, is it time their long-serving black bass player won more recognition?

A BBC poll conducted in October found that 32% of all women are considering cosmetic surgery. Among those under 35, the number rises to 45%. Tina is one of many young women to have had a cosmetic procedure. "It was almost too easy," she says. "Before I knew it, the injection had gone in and I thought, 'Oh my God, I am having a lip job'. It looked horrendous straight after. Really swollen. I was awake from 02:00 until 05:00 in the bathroom keeping an eye on my lip. I was worried it might explode. And I felt ashamed for having done it just for vanity's sake."

Albania has become the largest producer of outdoor-grown cannabis in Europe, with an illicit industry worth as much as five billion euros a year - or about half of the country's GDP. "I've produced 350kg," says one farmer. "This year almost every single house in the village grew cannabis - tons and tons have been produced in this community alone. This is our curse - there are no jobs, no work here. There's no money in growing anything else. I know it's not a good thing I'm doing, but there's no other way."

"I'm Sarah, I'm 28. I'm an NHS junior doctor and I self-harmed for just over 11 years. After a while on anti-depressants I started seeing a psychiatrist who referred me for therapy. I had 18 months of intensive art psychotherapy and during that time I reduced my cutting. The last year of university was about twice in the year and now I haven't cut for nearly two years. I haven't had any real negative reactions [to my scars] from patients - I find it's more from work colleagues that I struggle with."
