The public sector pay cap remains top of the agenda for several of Tuesday's newspapers.
According to the Guardian, a report for the government's pay advisers has revealed the scale of salary cuts during a decade of freezes - teachers have seen average pay fall by £3 an hour in real terms and police officers by £2 an hour, while the wages of nurses stagnated.
The paper says the academic analysis was "quietly" published on Monday, and talks of the prime minister facing a "cabinet showdown" over the issue.
The Daily Mirror also predicts a "Tory revolt" and tells Prime Minister Theresa May: "take the cap off".
"Now put your money where your mouth is," says the paper's front-page headline, "give heroes a decent rise".
The Daily Mail says Chancellor Philip Hammond is refusing to budge on the issue.
The Sun reckons Tory MPs and ministers demanding a lift to public sector pay have "lost the plot".
Writing in the same paper, the former Tory chancellor, Lord Lamont, tells his party to "get a grip". Control of public expenditure, he says, is the foundation of jobs growth in the future.

The Times says it's learnt that ministers are pushing to delay or abandon a series of tax cuts to fund an increase in public sector pay.
It reports that the chancellor is being urged to scrap commitments to reduce corporation tax and increase thresholds for the personal allowance and 40% income tax rate.
An editorial in the Daily Telegraph says the "cacophony of Tory opinions must stop", as it is giving the impression of an administration all at sea.
The Daily Mail says it's seen secret files revealing that NHS officials in the 1970s knew for at least five years that haemophilia patients were being given contaminated blood.
Newly unearthed minutes of meetings held in the 1980s are said to show that officials consciously put patients at risk in a scandal which cost 2,000 lives.
Scientists were so sure the blood was dangerous, the Mail says, that they even planned to use victims as guinea pigs to develop a new test for hepatitis.
The Telegraph leads on an article inside by Lord Grade, who heads the new Fundraising Regulator for charities.
Charities that pester donors for cash face being fined up to £25,000 under new rules introduced this week. Lord Grade says many charities are behaving like "laggards", refusing to change their behaviour.
The Sun reports that a man convicted of knife crime who was jailed for nine years has been freed, because court staff wrote nine months on prison forms.
A warrant's been issued for the re-arrest of 25-year-old Ralston Dodd but he's apparently gone into hiding.
A friend tells the paper: "He feels like he's won the lottery". The Ministry of Justice says it is "urgently investigating so we learn the lessons to prevent it happening again".
Finally, the Daily Express tells readers a blast of heat from the continent is on the way, which will send temperatures "rocketing" back to the low 90s Fahrenheit, or more than 30C.
