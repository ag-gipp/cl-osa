East London double acid attack: John Tomlin appears in court

A man accused of throwing acid at a student and her cousin through their car window has appeared in court.
Resham Khan and Jameel Muhktar, 37, had been celebrating Ms Khan's 21st birthday before the attack.
Acid was thrown on them through their car window on 21 June while they were waiting at traffic lights in Beckton.
John Tomlin, 25, appeared at Thames Magistrates' Court earlier charged with two counts of grievous bodily harm with intent.
He was remanded in custody and ordered to appear at Snaresbrook Crown Court on 8 August.
Mr Tomlin, of Colman Road, Canning Town, was arrested on Sunday after handing himself in to police.
Ms Khan, a student at Manchester Metropolitan University, and Mr Muhktar suffered severe burns to the face and body in the attack at 09:13 BST on Tollgate Road.
The attacker then threw more of the acid at Mr Muhktar before fleeing the scene, police said.
