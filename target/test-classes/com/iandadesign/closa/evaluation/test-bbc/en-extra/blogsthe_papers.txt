Theresa May's former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, has been speaking to the Daily Telegraph to explain where he thinks the general election campaign went wrong for the Conservatives.
In what the paper bills as his first interview since resigning - although he did write one magazine article a few days later - he says the Tories lost their majority because they abandoned Mrs May's promise of "change" in favour of a "continuity" message.
Mr Timothy suggests that other advisers chose the style of the campaign - with its close focus on the prime minister's initial popularity - but says he takes responsibility for what he did.
The Telegraph says Mr Timothy insisted he would not point the finger of blame but it says his answers leave no doubt of the tensions that existed between Downing Street staff and the election strategists who were brought in, including Sir Lynton Crosby.
