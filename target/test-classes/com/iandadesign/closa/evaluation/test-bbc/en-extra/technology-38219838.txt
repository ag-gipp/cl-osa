BBC 100 Women 2016: How to join our edit-a-thon

Did you know that only around 17% of notable profiles on Wikipedia are of women?
100 Women are partnering with multiple global outlets at the BBC and the Wikipedia community to hold a 12-hour edit-a-thon on 8 December and close the gender gap. There will be 15 events in 13 countries happening in multiple languages to grow the number of female editors and to add women who you think deserve to be recognised.
Both women and men can take part in the event, either on your own computer, or at the BBC's London headquarters in New Broadcasting House, where you will be trained in editing by volunteers from Wikimedia UK.
