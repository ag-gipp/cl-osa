If David Cameron had a replay of last week's parliamentary vote, he would have waited for Barack Obama to announce first.
Whether the US president's weekend decision to seek Congressional approval first occurred to him before or after Mr Cameron's stunning reversal is now moot.
Even though he now risks being accused of prevarication, Mr Obama is right to seek authorisation. He is also right to couch the request for military action in narrow and limited terms.
But he needs to do a far better job of explaining his broader strategy on Syria.
Failure to spell it out could jeopardise the clear majorities he will need in both chambers of Congress.
Defeat in either chamber would deal a grievous blow to his presidency.
The case for US-led international action is strong and becoming stronger.
By killing at least 1,000 civilians with sarin gas last month, the Assad regime has traduced the most basic humanitarian norms.
It could do so again.
Failure to register the world's disapproval – and its willingness to respond – would embolden the Assads and their supporters.
In contrast to Mr Cameron's cobbled-together approach, the Obama administration has made a coherent, forceful case for limited, punitive strikes.
On the draft resolution's language alone, Mr Obama deserves a Yes vote from Capitol Hill as soon as practical – preferably before the end of next week.
But Mr Obama still needs to make a stronger case for the course on which he has embarked.
On the resolution, he has made it clear he is requesting, not requiring, Congress's approval – in contrast to Libya in 2011, when he said he already had the authority to act.
Some officials have hinted Mr Obama would press ahead with the strikes regardless of the US vote.
That would be a mistake.
The president has rightly staked his case on grounds of principle and he should stay there.
The second concern is about Mr Obama's strategy on the ground in Syria.
While it makes sense to confine the rationale for strikes to chemical weapons, the debate over regime change is only going to intensify.
Mr Assad looks likely to respond to the US strikes in some form.
There will be no good options available.
On the plus side, Mr Obama has bought himself time to push for a diplomatic breakthrough at the G20 summit in St Petersburg next week and elsewhere.
That, too, may be a long shot.
But he needs to work tirelessly on creating some less bad options for himself.
