If Shakespeare were alive today, he would have had a good line in business books. Macbeth is a primer in how (not) to be a corporate wife;
The Merchant of Venice is a cautionary tale about reckless lending.
The play Stanley Ho should have read, however, is The Tragedy of King Lear.
It is not clear how the ageing king of Macao's casinos intended to divide his gambling empire among his progeny.
Instead, as in the play, it became apparent this week that the kingdom Mr Ho had built – and thought was his to distribute – had already been lost.
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child, as King Lear himself said.
Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend, Mr Ho must have muttered when he discovered that the majority stake in his gaming and hotels business was already held by his third wife and five children from his second marriage.
It would be understandable if Mr Ho, like Lear, had difficulty distinguishing confessions of devotion from the real thing. After all, he has had four wives and at least 15 children.
But he shares the king's fate in now accusing his relatives of grabbing the family business.
Lear could have told Mr Ho to make clear and public provision for distributing his estimated $3.1bn fortune among “younger strengths”.
Instead, Mr Ho this week repeatedly changed his instructions.
Storms raged around an anguished Lear; the jangle of slot machines must be clanging in Mr Ho's head.
Mr Ho's decades-long monopoly of the Macao casinos won him enemies as well as friends, but this is a sorry saga for a man “at the verge of life”.
King Lear teaches us not to hope for a sweet ending now – this is Shakespeare's ultimate tragedy that plays out in five painful acts.
With teams of lawyers, 21st-century financial systems and far more progeny, the unfolding tale of Mr Ho's disappearing kingdom looks set to go on for far longer than that.
