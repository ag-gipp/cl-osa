Financial markets eye new peaks, yet output is everywhere decelerating or shrinking.
Contradictory as these phenomena seem, both may be traced back to the actions – and inaction – of central banks.
Credit where credit is due: monetary policy makers have done more than most to halt the collapse of the world's economies in 2008–09 and to help their recovery since.
Very low interest rates and huge expansions of their balance sheets averted a worse credit crunch.
But they have also caused a rising tide in asset prices reaching as far as emerging economies a world away from the sources of liquidity.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit an all-time high this week; more than catching up with losses racked up during the financial crisis.
The DJIA is a flawed index but its recovery is shared with other, more representative measures of equity performance, both in the US and elsewhere.
A Martian observer of stock markets might be forgiven for thinking all must be well with the earth's economies.
But little of investors' exuberance is reflected in core economic data.
Central bankers' goal was never, of course, to inflate new asset bubbles but to give rapidly deflating economies a powerful shot in the arm.
Tragically, the side-effects – asset valuations – have responded more enthusiastically than the ultimate object (in reality if not in name) of improving growth.
The US and the UK ended the year stagnant; the eurozone and Japan in renewed recession; the emerging world slowing down.
There is some hope in the US, where housing has turned a corner.
Change is coming to Japan, where the new brooms at the central bank have vowed to kill deflation for good and seem to mean it.
But in Europe little good news is in sight, unless one counts the suspension of the eurozone's self-immolation.
While the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have taken extraordinary measures, the sad fact is that these have not been enough.
The ECB, in particular, cannot be satisfied with convincing markets it will not let the euro disintegrate.
Its interest rate remains higher than it needs to be.
Disturbingly, private-sector credit conditions, tepid throughout the eurozone, vary widely from one country to another.
The ECB has reined in sovereign bond spreads; it must now work harder on the private sector equivalent: a severe credit crunch in the periphery but a cash glut in the core.
The UK holds high hopes for “funding for lending”, the latest prod to banks to lend.
A modest example of fiscal-monetary co-operation, this clever structure rewards banks with cheap funding if they expand their loan book or do not cut it too much.
Yet real improvement has yet to materialise: overall lending fell in the last quarter.
Central banks' challenge is a banking system that acts as a brake on the money creation they carry out.
The ECB does not have powers to respond; the BoE is only now obtaining them.
Both rely on government action.
Central banks must act – but also press governments harder to play their part.
