It has long been clear that the governance of the International Monetary Fund is not fit for purpose.
The distribution of voting rights, based on each country's contribution to the fund's equity, is skewed against emerging countries.
The likes of Brazil, China and India matter less than they should given the size of their economy or their recent rates of growth.
In 2010, the US spearheaded a reform that would give developing economies a greater say over how the fund is run.
For example, Beijing would increase its voting rights from 4 to 6 per cent.
Yet, three years later, Congress has yet to ratify the agreement.
Since the US holds de facto veto power over the IMF's key decisions, Washington is holding up a step towards making global economic governance more democratic.
The sticking point of the reform is that it would require the US to increase its own contributions to the fund by $65bn.
This is anathema to some Republicans in the House, who think the US has already paid enough.
President Obama supports the increase, but has so far been reluctant to risk political capital to make it happen.
Last November, before the presidential election, he backed off from asking for funding approval.
The price of this delay is rising, however.
A further round of reforms of the IMF quota system has begun this year and will be completed in January 2014.
The US failure to ratify the previous deal means that Washington has less influence in the discussions.
Democrats, which control the Senate, have the chance to make amends.
They should include the quota increase in the so-called “continuing resolution” bill, a law to fund the government that must pass by the end of this month.
Republicans should not obstruct it.
The US need not increase its exposure to the fund, but can shift resources away from a separate pot of $100bn Washington pledged to lend to the IMF as needed.
The reform of the quota system is only one step to change the IMF.
Just as important is to ensure that its managing director is chosen on the basis of a truly competitive process.
So far, the Europeans have always claimed the job for themselves.
This 70 year-old practice is out of date in today's rapidly changing world.
