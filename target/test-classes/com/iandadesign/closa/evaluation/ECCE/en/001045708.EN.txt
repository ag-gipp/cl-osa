George Osborne can draw little comfort from the latest UK economic data.
Initial estimates by the Office of National Statistics show that national income declined in the latest quarter by 0.7 per cent, deepening the double-dip recession and heaping more pressure on the already embattled chancellor.
While the economy was widely expected to shrink, the scale of the contraction surprised on the downside.
Mr Osborne said there were “no excuses”.
But the figures are a puzzle, being hard to reconcile with more positive data from the job market and tax receipts.
Beyond questions about the data's accuracy, the three months to July were unusual.
Poor weather is likely to have contributed to the sharp fall in construction activity.
The additional bank holiday for the diamond jubilee meant that in many sectors, production stopped for an extra day.
Such caveats, however, cannot disguise the uncomfortable truth.
Even if the numbers were out by, say, half a percentage point, the UK would still be stumbling along the bottom rather than recovering.
Mr Osborne must do more to help the economy back on track.
There will be calls for the chancellor to respond by relaxing his deficit-reduction programme.
As this newspaper has always argued, Mr Osborne has made a rod for his own back by insisting that he will never change course.
But relaxation of fiscal policy should only be used a last resort.
It is the clumsiest of weapons and could backfire if mishandled.
For now, there is more the government can do while staying within its fiscal envelope.
To support construction, Mr Osborne should bring forward investment spending, cutting current expenditure harder to make room.
Planning reform should be more than a pious aspiration; it must be acted upon.
More can also be done with monetary policy.
The Bank of England should cut its policy rate further.
Once the current round of quantitative easing is completed in November, it should think about a further round.
It should also consider other unconventional asset purchasing schemes.
Economically, Britain is not an island.
The turmoil in the eurozone is such that no policy decision made in Westminster alone will necessarily restore full confidence among businesses and consumers.
But this is no excuse for the chancellor to sit on his hands.
In counteracting the present stagnation, he must use more of the levers at his disposal.
