 

Activated polymorphnuclear leucocytes (PMN) also allured over a chemotactical gradient, release extra mediators such as oxygen radicals and enzymes and additionally raise the endothelium permeability. The granulocyte infiltration and the edema of the interstitial septen can be confirmed in the histological preparation (van Griensven et al., 1999). Likewise after a traumatic brain injury one can presumably observe organ impairments through irritation of the brainstem and the corresponding vegetative centers. The neurogenic pulmonary edema portrays the most commonly known extracerebral organ manifestation of an acute traumatic brain injury. Direct damage to the brainstem leads pathogenetically to this immediate appearance.
