4.1. Lung, liver, spleen and kidney 

Traumas associated with a shock incident and consequently with hypovolemia and hypoxia result in an activation of entire defense systems, which among others lead to the activation of neutrophil granulocytes and their invasion in the lungs (van Griensven et al., 2002). Since the lung serves in the circulation as the first filter “station” for toxins, cytokines and activated blood cells, it presents itself within the scope of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) as the first organ to be affected and most often worst impaired in its function (Regel et al., 1996). Cytokines impact the endothelial tissue of the blood vessels, leading to an intensified extravasation of cells, blood components and fluid in the [tissue.]
