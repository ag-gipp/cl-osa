Qualitative analysis of the Nissl stained slices disclosed clear changes of the cortical cell architecture at the maximal site of the traumatic brain injury in the CCI and polytrauma group. Loss of the vertical cell architecture, edematous loosening and disintegration of the cortical cells was observed. In addition, a distinct decrease in the thickness of vital emerging neurons occured. Degenerative alterations like tigrolytic changes and pyknotic aggregation of the cell nuclei could be seen. Loss of vital emerging neurons was also seen in the Fx-Shock group. During the assessment of the Hippocampus, we mainly focused on the hypoxaemia and trauma sensitive regions of the cornu amonis (CA). Variations in the form of partly high grade damaged neurons could be observed in the CA3 region of the CCI side (Fig. 7). Low grade changes of this nature were also seen on the contra lateral side. Such low grade changes were also observed in the animals of the Fx-Shock group. [...]
