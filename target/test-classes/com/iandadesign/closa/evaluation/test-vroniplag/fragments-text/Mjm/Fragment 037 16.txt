The hydropic degeneration of the livers shows cell damage with increased fluid accumulation in the cytoplasma . A significant variance was determined (p = 0.017). There were no middle to high grade changes neither in the CCI group nor in the poly trauma group, and the livers with low grade change outweighed the unaffected livers. In the poly trauma group, more livers exhibited a low grade hydropic degeneration as in the CCi group. Half of the livers in the Fx-Shock group had hydropic degeneration at middle to high value.
