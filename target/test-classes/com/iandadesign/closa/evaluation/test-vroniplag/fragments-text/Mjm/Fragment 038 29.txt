The specific staining with GFAP was used to analyse the astrogliosis both cortical and hippocampal. During the qualitative observation, a distinct hyperplasia and hypotrophia of the astrocytes were conspicuous. These occured cortical, were particularly observable on the medial and lateral rim of the CCI induced cavity and extended subcortically within the adjacent white matter. In the center of the contusion, the reactive gliosis appeared distinctly weak. In this regard almost no abnormal findings could be observed in the brains or brain hemispheres without CCI. GFAP positive astrocyts were identified in the white matter only. In the hippocampus, however, a distinct bilateral reactive gliosis was shown partly in both the CCI group and the polytrauma group. The quantification of this astrogliosis is possible by consideration of hypertrophia as well as proliferative changes. Selected cortical and hippocampal areas were examined in three slices of each brain. The slices of the CCI side were within the maximal trauma cavity. The analysis of the posttraumatic damages is shown by Figs. 8 and 9. Both illustrate the development and allocation pattern of the astrocytic reaction in side-by-side comparison.
