5. Conclusion 

The experimental polytrauma model from traumatic brain injury and femur fracture with hemorrhagic shock in mice, which has been presented here, fulfills the requirements of a standardized animal model. It allows adequate analogies and inferences to the clinical situation of a polytrauma in humans and thereby portrays the associated characteristic clinical, pathological and histopathological changes.
