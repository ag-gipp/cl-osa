Extent and velocity of postvibration force generation were analyzed by fitting a monoexponential function to the time course of post vibration force recovery with the form: T = T<sub>ss</sub> - A<sup>-t/&beta;</sup> (T = force (mN), T<sub>ss</sub>=steady-state force after complete force increase (mN), A = amplitude (mN) and &beta; = time constant of the force increase after cessation of vibration (s), t = time after after cessation of vibration (s) (Fig. 2)). The extent of postvibration force recovery (PVFR) is related to the number of attached cross-bridges. The time course of PVFR – characterized by time constants of an exponential function – reflects the actin myosin interaction kinetics (14). [ [EN 14]: Klemt. P. U., Peiper B. N., Speden, and E.
