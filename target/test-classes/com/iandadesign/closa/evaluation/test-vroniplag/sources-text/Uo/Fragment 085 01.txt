Two films celebrating this historical event were simultaneously screened on 16 February 1913. THE ACCESSION OF THE HOUSE OF ROMANOV was full of historical mistakes and lacked the necessary care in the choice of costumes and props. THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF ROMANOV DYNASTY was situated in the present and included some newsreel footage. The government did not allow actors to represent the tsars, so the producers replaced them by sculptures and portraits, often with ridiculous results.
