The joint centre, joint line and mechanical femoral axis are visible on the x-ray template and are brought into alignment with the x-ray image. The dotted line which mostly closely corresponds to the anatomical axis gives the correct angle. To define the position of the tibia resection, the whole leg template is brought into alignment with the x-ray. The resection height is given by the scale from 10 -22 [sic] mm. The depiction of the intramedullary femur alignment rod on the whole leg template makes it possible to check the position and entry point of the rod by comparing it with the x-ray image. If pronounced bone deformities are present, it is not always possible to use the alignment rod.
