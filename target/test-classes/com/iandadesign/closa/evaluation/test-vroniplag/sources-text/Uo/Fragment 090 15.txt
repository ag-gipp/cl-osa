The number of cameramen filming each war increased steadily in this period, from the individuals who covered the wars of 1897 and 1898, to some half dozen cameramen in the Boer War (1899-1902) and over twenty who filmed the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913.1 1 It is worth adding that there were also huge numbers of newspaper journalists at these wars: the Spanish-American War has been dubbed ‘the Correspondents’ war’, and there were more journalists’ boats off Cuba in 1898 than naval vessels; while in the Balkans in late 1912, there were literally scores of journalists with the Bulgarian and Turkish forces.
