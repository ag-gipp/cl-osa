In DeLong et al. (1990a) there are two types of traders, noise traders and sophisticated, rational traders. There are two assets, a safe asset paying a fixed dividend r in each period, and a risky asset paying an uncertain dividend $ r + \epsilon_t $, where t is IID, normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $ \sigma^2_\epsilon $ . The price of the unsafe asset in period t is denoted by $ p_t $. Noise traders incorrectly believe that they have special information about the future price of the risky asset. For example, they use signals from technical analysts, stock brokers or economic consultants and irrationally believe that these signals carry information and select their portfolios based upon these incorrect beliefs. For sophisticated traders it is optimal to exploit noise traders misperceptions. Sophisticated traders buy (sell) when noise traders depress (push up) prices. This contrarian trading strategy pushes prices in the direction of the fundamental value, but not completely. For both trader types, demand for the risky asset is derived from expected utility maximization of constant absolute risk aversion utility of tomorrowâ€™s wealth, $ \lambda_t^R = \frac{r+E_tp_{t+1}-(1+r)p_t}{2\gamma(\sigma^2_p{t+1}+\sigma_\epsilon^2)}, $ $ \lambda_t^N = \frac{r+E_tp_{t+1}-(1+r)p_t}{2\gamma(\sigma^2_p{t+1}+\sigma_\epsilon^2)} + \frac{p_t}{2\gamma(\sigma^2_p{t+1}+\sigma^2_\epsilon)} $ where $ \gamma $ is the coefficient of absolute risk aversion, $ E_t[p_{t+1}] $ is the expected price at date t + 1 conditional on information up to time t, $ \sigma^2_{p_{t+1}} $ is the expected one period variance of $ p_{t+1} $ and $ p_{t} $ is the misperception of the expected price for tomorrow by the noise trader. [...] The misperception of noise traders is an exogenously given IID normally distributed random variable with mean $ \rho^* $ and variance $ \sigma^2_\rho $.
