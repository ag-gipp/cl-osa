As our society advanced scientifically during the past half-century, it became increasingly more difficult for some in the health care community to give credence to the importance of the spiritual nature of the human person, especially in relation to health/illness issues. More recently, however, caregivers are recognizing that sensitivity to a patient's spiritual needs is critical if they are to provide truly "holistic" health care. Nurse and minister Ann Robinson (1995) believes that nurses must "embrace the spirituality of the human community" in order to support their patients' holistic health behaviors (p. 3). Authors Dossey and Keegan (1989) defined the concept of holism, which undergirds holistic health [â€¦] including the body, mind, and spirit connection, as "the view that including the body, mind, and spirit connection, as "the view that an integrated whole has a reality independent of and greater than the sum of its parts" (p. 4). They described holism as consisting of a philosophy of positive, interactionally based attitudes and behaviors that can exist not only in one who is well but also in one who is seriously or terminally ill (p. 5). Nurses practicing care supportive of such holism need to envision the spiritual needs of a patient as deserving of attention equal to that provided in response to physical and psychosocial concerns. Overall, holistic nursing is supported by and alternately supports the intimate connection or body, mind, and spirit. Nursing of the whole person requires attention to the individuality and uniqueness of each dimension, as well as to the interrelatedness of the three. In The Wholeness Handbook, Emeth and Oreenhut (1991) described the body, mind, and spirit elements: The body is the physical substance of a person that can be Perceived in empirical reality; the mind is that dimension of an individual that conceptualizes; and the spirit is the life principle that is shared with all humanity and with God.
