Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children is a rare disease that is being increasingly diagnosed and recognized, usually as a secondary complication of primary underlying medical diseases such as sepsis, cancer, and congenital heart disease, as well as therapeutic interventions such as the use of central venous lines.1–6 Pediatric VTE is a severe condition for which long-term outcomes have included lack of thrombus resolution in 50% of cases and, excluding central line–associated thrombosis in children with malignancy, the development of postthrombotic syndrome in more than one [Seite 1374] third of patients.7–11 Within the entire childhood population, neonates are at the greatest risk of thromboembolism (5.1/ 100 000 live births per year in white children), with a second peak in incidence during puberty and adolescence.2 In prospective pediatric registries in North America and Europe, the annual incidence of venous events was estimated to be 0.7 to 1.4 per 100 000 children or 5.3 per 10 000 hospital admissions of children and 24 per 10 000 admissions of neonates to neonatal intensive care units.6,12–14 [...] The results of single studies of the risk of VTE onset and recurrence associated with inherited thrombophilia (IT) have been contradictory or inconclusive, mainly because of a lack of statistical power. Apart from acquired thrombophilic risk factors such as the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, 15–18 IT—particularly antithrombin, protein C, and protein S deficiency, variants of coagulation factor V (G1691A) and factor II (G20210A), and elevated lipoprotein(a)– have been established as risk factors for venous thromboembolic events in adults.19–29 The allele frequencies for the factor V G1691A or factor II G20210A variants differ among various ethnic groups.30–32 In children with idiopathic VTE and in pediatric populations in which thromboses were associated with underlying medical diseases, IT has been described as an additional prothrombotic risk factor.33–101
