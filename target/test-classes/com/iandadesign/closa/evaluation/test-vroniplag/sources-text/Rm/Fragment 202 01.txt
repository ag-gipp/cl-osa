In Garland v. British Rail Engineering Ltd.,63 Lord Diplock stated that where a statute relating to 'British treaty obligations' had to be construed, and the statutory words were reasonably capable - 'without undue straining of the ordinary meaning of language'- off bearing a meaning that was consistent with those treaty obligations, they should be given that meaning. That principle, Lord Diplock said, applied with special force to Community law, but he left open what the effect of section 2 (4) of the 1972 Act would be where a direct conflict between a British Act and Community law existed that could not be resolved by recourse to interpretation. In reliance on the approach laid down in Garland v. British Rail Engineering Ltd., the House of Lords applied a purposive interpretation to national regulations that were intended to give effect to Community bligations.64 So too, where the Equal Pay Act 1970 had been amended by means of ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972, the Lords held that the amended text of the Act must be interpreted so as to give effect to the United Kingdom's obligations under mmunity law; in doing this, the court used the debates that took place when the amending regulations were before Parliament to discover the intention behind them.65 Neither in Garland nor in other cases on sex discrimination66 did the question directly arise as to the position should Parliament itself choose to legislate inconsistently with Community law. That issue arose in R. v. Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte Factortame Ltd.67 [...] 63 [1983] 2 AC 751; and see T. R. S. Allan (1982) Public Law 562. 64 Litster v.
