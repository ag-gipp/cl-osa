Among studies that have examined the efficacy of religious and spiritual interventions for treating anxiety problems, most have employed meditation as a relaxation technique. Indeed, several meditation studies suggest that such interventions can significantly reduce anxiety in individuals with either mild or severe anxiety problems. For example, Carlson et al. (1988) conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of devotional meditation (DM) on physiological state and psychological stress.
