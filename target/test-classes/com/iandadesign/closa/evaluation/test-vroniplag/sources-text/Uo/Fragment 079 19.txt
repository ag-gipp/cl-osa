[Seite 17] Nineteen hundred thirteen. The last year of the old Europe, the Europe of the 19th century. If one looks at the map of this continent, only three countries were republics: the eternal Switzerland, France (after the fall of the second Empire) and Portugal (since 1910). All other countries were monarchies, constitutional monarchies to be precise, with two exceptions: two German principalities (Mecklenburg Strelitz and Mecklenburg Schwerin) were governed by absolute rulers. The German empire had four kingdoms, eleven duchies and seven principalities in 1913. Hundreds of monarchs, emperors, kings and dukes were the most important persons in Europe, the true VIPs. [...] They were the favourite stars in film, seen in newsreels by millions of cinema-goers. In PATHÉ JOURNAL 265 (4 April 1913) one could see in four separate reports the King of Bavaria, the King of Saxony, the Emperor of Austria-Hungary and the English royal couple. In St. Petersburg the police ordered that film images of the tsarist family had to be screened separately from the ordinary newsreel, with curtains raised at the beginning and falling at the end, while no accompanying music was allowed. [Seite 18] What about the actual situation of the cinema in Central and Eastern Europe or, to be more precise, in the three empires Austria-Hungary, Germany and Russia? The first characteristic is the development of the new medium as an industry: [...] The second trait is the freedom of the distribution of films, and the truly international character of all markets: no quotas and protective custom barriers existed. This slightly idyllic picture is not complete without a third trait, the powerful position of France. The three leading French companies, Pathé Frères, Gaumont and Eclair, had local offices in the three empires.
