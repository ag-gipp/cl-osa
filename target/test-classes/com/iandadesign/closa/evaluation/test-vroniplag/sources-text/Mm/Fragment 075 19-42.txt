If we look over the whole development of interest in European history within the general development of American historiography, we can distinguish two basically different ways of linking the history of the Old World to the historical experience of America. the first is characterized by a chronological conception: European history is considered mainly as a pre-history of America, as a kind of introductory phase in which the ideas and traditions that were to make American nation what it is, began to emerge but did not find their true and lasting fulfilment. The second approach is based on the consciousness of a historical community in which America and Europe play equal roles as parts of the same Western World. The first approach naturally led American scholars to the study of the earlier periods of European history, while the second furthered thier interests in the more recent developments. In addition to this it can be generally observed that American historians who adopted the first way of looking at the European past tended to be primarily interested in the history of political institutions, religion and culture, while the adherents of the second method showed a distinctive preference for problems of international relations, diplomatic and economic history.[...] The historians who see the European past mainly in terms of a pre-history or pre-formation of American fulfilments tend to stress the unity of cultural heritage. Those who see European history as part of an Atlantic context are more inclined to define it as a unity of fate. Down to the end of the nineteenth century, American scholars of European history were mainly interested in the unity of heritage. It is only natural that the idea of an historical unity of fate should have impressed them more and more at the time when the United States attained the stature of a world power and became involved in the global conflicts and problems which characterize the twentieth century.
