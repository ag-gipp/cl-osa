The situation regarding lung cancer mortality in people aged under 65 years is more complex. Men from the former GDR consistently showed higher, and women lower, mortality rates than their counterparts in the previous territories of the Federal Republic. [Seite 18] In 1993, SDRs for both sexes in Germany as a whole were below the EU average. Between 1983 and 1993 women experienced one of the highest increases among the reference countries (48% against an EU average of 14%). During the same period the trend for men in the whole of Germany was almost stable, mainly due to the fact that in the former GDR male death rates from lung cancer fell in line with the general trend in the EU whereas they went up slightly in the previous territories of the Federal Republic where a declining trend only emerged after 1990. The Mainz Children's Cancer Register, with a coverage of about 95% in the former territorities of the Federal Republic, showed a standardized incidence rate among children aged under 15 years of 14 per 100 000 between 1985 and 1989. The rate was higher among boys (14.7) than girls (12.1) (Federal Ministry of Health 1994). [Seite 19] A longitudinal comparison of the data from the Cancer Register of the former GDR and one of the LÃ¤nder (Saarland) showed that the incidences of cancer of stomach, cervix and uterus as well as Hodgkin's lymphomas decreased in the early 1990s compared to the previous decade. Over the same period the incidence of liver, bladder, lung and female breast cancer as well as malignant melanoma increased (Federal Ministry of Health 1997a).
