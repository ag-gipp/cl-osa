Since 1990, the number of sickness funds has been gradually reduced from 1300 to 600, of which less than 10% are run by private insurance companies (Schulenburg 1994, Federal Ministry of Health 1997a and 1997b, European Parliament 1998). [...] In 1997, some 75% of the population had a mandatory [Seite 38] health insurance, because their income fell below a fixed level or because they were unemployed. Some 13% voluntarily joined the statutory sickness funds and 10%, mainly civil servants, were covered by their employers. Most of the remaining population mainly high-income earners had private health insurance. Less than 0.5% of the population were uninsured. Since 1995/1996 insured persons have been free to choose their sickness fund and to change from one to another. In the beginning this did not have a major effect in practice, since all relevant parameters e.g. premium calculation, benefits and prices were regulated and uniform for all funds. Since the mid-1990s, competition between sick funds has been promoted (Federal Ministry of Health 1997b, European Parliament 1998). [...] Germany has experienced a severe shortage of nurses in all parts of the hospital system, even though their number increased remarkably in the first half of the 1990s. Newly qualified nurses tend to join private nursing companies specialising in home care (Moran 1992, European Parliament 1998). The ratio of nurses per 100 physicians is one of the lowest in the EU; only the Mediterranean countries have lower ratios.
