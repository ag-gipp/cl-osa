[Seite 3] AN OVERVIEW OF THE HEALTH SITUATION Positive trends The improvement in the health of the German population is illustrated by a steady increase in life expectancy at birth as a result of a reduction in death rates for most of the main causes of mortality. As this trend has either been less pronounced or delayed in the LÃ¤nder of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), the situation in this part of Germany is less favourable, as reflected in markedly lower life expectancy. The rise in life expectancy is due in particular to success in avoiding premature male mortality, i.e. deaths before the age of 65 years. Infant and maternal mortality has decreased substantially since 1980. In the early 1990s both were below the EU averages. Mortality from all external causes (mainly deaths due to accidents, including poisoning and violent deaths) has seen a large reduction since 1980. The decrease in standardized death rates (SDRs) for road traffic accidents and suicide was particularly marked in both sexes. Negative trends In 1993, life expectancy at age 65 was still considerably below the EU average, despite an above average increase during the 1980s. The SDRs for men and women aged 064 years remained above the EU averages for all cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and ischaemic heart disease, despite considerable reductions since 1980.
