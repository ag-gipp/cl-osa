Burell (1996) conducted a randomized clinical trial in Sweden that evaluated the effects of a behavioral intervention on prognosis following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. A total of 261 subjects (mean age 58) had undergone CABG three to 12 months prior to participating in the study. Of these 128 subjects were randomly assigned to a behavioral intervention group that received one year of the intervention, followed by five or six booster sessions during years 2 and 3 of the study. The other 133 subjects were assigned to a routine-care control group. Subjects in the intervention group were subdivided into small groups of 5-9 persons who underwent three-hour group sessions every third week during the first year (17 sessions). Six of the sessions involved education about CAD and how psychological factors influence well-being; the subjects were given homework to observe their health behaviors (eating, alcohol, smoking) and coronary-prone behaviors (Type A behaviors, depression, anxiety). The remainder of the group sessions focused on modifying coronary-prone activities by encouraging new reactions and behaviors— less impatience, irritation, hostility, depression, and stress and more “reflecting on spiritual issues” (Burell, 1996, p. 298). The results of the study, assessed five to seven years after CABG, showed a significant difference in total mortality between the intervention and the control groups (7 vs. 16 deaths, p = .02). Subjects w'ho received the intervention also spent fewer days than control subjects in the coronary' care unit (243 vs. 416 days). Both Type A behavior and depression were significandy reduced among subjects who received the behavioral intervention.
