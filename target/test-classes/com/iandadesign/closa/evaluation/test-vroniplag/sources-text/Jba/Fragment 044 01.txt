This is significantly below the average number of children desired (2.1 among young married couples) as estimated according to a national representative survey performed in 1991 (Hungarian Central Statistical Office, 1996a). [Seite 8] HEALTH STATUS A summary of recent changes in Hungary’s health position compared to the reference countries (Fig. 3) shows: In general, Hungary’s position relative to the other reference countries was poor both in 1985 and in 1998. Although the relative position for most indicators appears to have improved, this been largely due to a deterioration in the health of certain other reference countries (especially the Baltic states), rather than any marked improvement in health in Hungary. Hungary has by far the highest premature mortality rates among the reference countries for lung and breast cancers, as well as cancers overall, and it’s relative position has also worsened on these indicators. This situation is unlikely to improve in the medium term for lung cancer and all cancers, as Hungarian mortality rates from these causes are still increasing (see pages 14 and 23), as are adult female and teenage smoking rates (see page 22). The difference between male and female life expectancy has increased over this period, and this is reflected in the deterioration in Hungary’s position relative to the other reference countries.
