The International Exploration of Cinematic Expressivity [...] It has commonly been assumed that during the 1910s, cinematic techniques developed in the directions of clarity and expressivity. This change occurred mainly in the USA, Italy, and Scandinavia. [...] [...] I suspect that by around 1912, enough of these techniques were in place that many film-makers were able to tell stories clearly. At about this time, some directors went further, exploring the expressive possibilities of the medium. I am using the term ‘expressivity’ broadly and simply here, to mean those functions of cinematic devices that go beyond presenting basic narrative information and add some quality to the scene that would not be strictly necessary to our comprehension of it. In many cases such expressive devices were included in order to deepen the spectator’s emotional involvement in the action. Increased suspense during a chase, deeper sympathy for a character in distress, awe over the sudden revelation of a spectacular setting - such tactics could push the spectator beyond comprehension to fascination. Traditional historians have typically assumed that the growing sophistication of the cinema in this period lay in its move from a theatre-based art form to a more independent, ‘cinematic’ art. For years, this led to an emphasis on those techniques which most seemed to separate cinema from the stage - primarily editing and camera [Seite 67] movement. Those films which employed distant framings, a static camera, painted sets, and/or long takes were considered to be backward. Thus, D.W. Griffith became the hero of the tale of editing’s evolution, CABIRIA was the landmark film for popularizing camera movement, and the Swedes were valued for taking the camera out into nature.
