However, as a result of regional consensus, a total of 18 000 hospital beds were closed, one fifth of all beds. In this process, compromises were made to close beds rather than entire hospitals, and no incentives were introduced to reduce referrals. Consequently, the resulting savings were smaller than expected, and the high hospitalization rates have continued. Inpatient admission rates vary significantly among the reference countries. Hungaryâ€™s rate increased by 15% from 1986 to 1998, and the most recent rate (23.6 per 100 in 1998) is one of the highest among the reference countries (average 17.1 per 100 in 1998) and was considerably higher than the EU average (19.0 per 100 in 1996) (Fig. 43). The average length of hospital stay has decreased in all reference countries since the 1980s. The average for Hungary was 13.6 days in 1985 but decreased to 9.1 in 1998. [...] The reported number of outpatient contacts also varies greatly among the reference countries: from 4.6 to 15.1 annual contacts per person in 1998. The number of outpatient contacts [Seite 35] in Hungary has increased by 25% since 1985, and the figure in 1998 (13.7) is one of the highest among reference countries. Pharmaceuticals and pharmacies Pharmaceutical manufacturing constitutes an important element of both industry and health care services. The state-owned pharmaceutical companies were privatized between 1991 and 1996. The wholesale trade of pharmaceuticals was owned by the state prior to 1990 and has now been privatized. In 1997, more than 90% of the retail pharmacies were privately owned (Ministry of Welfare, 1997a). In Hungary, only registered drugs are available on the market. Prior to 1990, people were required to make a nominal contribution to the price of drugs, as they were entitled to pharmaceuticals within the universal social security coverage. Since the establishment of a new insurance system, the health insurance scheme and the population share the burden, [...]
