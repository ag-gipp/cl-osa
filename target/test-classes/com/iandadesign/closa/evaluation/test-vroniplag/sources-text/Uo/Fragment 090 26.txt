I would argue that there were broadly two types of cameramen identifiable in this era: firstly, those who tried filming as a novelty, and secondly, the more technically trained men who remained cameramen for a long period of their lives (and who were usually lower on the social scale than the first group).2 The first group were often war correspondents, such as the very first man to take a film camera to a war, Frederic Villiers, a long-standing reporter, who filmed the brief Greco-Turkish conflict of 1897.3 Another cameraman in this category was John Benett-Stanford, also known as ‘Mad Jack’, an eccentric squire who took a film camera to the Battle of Omdurman in 1898 and to the Boer War the following year. 2 For more on the social background of cameramen in this period see: J. Ballantyne (ed.), Researchers’ Guide to British Newsreels, vol. 2, BUFVC, 1988, pp. 28-31. 2 See my article, ‘Frederic Villiers, war correspondent’, Sight and Sound, Autumn 1980, pp. 250-255.
