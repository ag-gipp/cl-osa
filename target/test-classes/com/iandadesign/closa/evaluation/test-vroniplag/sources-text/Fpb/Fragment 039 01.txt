The adenovirus-mediated localized arterial transduction of p130 at the time of vascular injury reduced neointimal hyperplasia and prevented restenosis by blocking SMC proliferation along with influencing the capacity to bind and sequester transcription factor regulators E2Fs. However, the lack of p130 and its biological function for vascular geometry under basal conditions and injury repair have not been studied to date. Furthermore, a considerable amount of studies has put emphasis on influencing neointima formation rather than studying vascular remodeling, a process that appears to be of utmost relevance for the clinical outcome post interventions and during atherosclerosis. [Seite 682] Many recent studies have pointed out a dominant role of vessel remodeling for luminal loss or gain, depending on the ratio between lumen area and vessel wall area [24,25]. Adaptive remodeling appears to be an early physiological reaction to compensate for lumen loss in atherosclerosis [25,26]. Following angioplasty, the impact of remodeling increases while the relative contribution of neointimal formation to late lumen loss decreases over time [27]. However, several clinical studies have established a remarkable inter-individual variability in the extent and direction of remodeling [28]. Constrictive remodeling has been partially related to the presence of specific environmental factors such as smoking [29,30] and diabetes [31]; but it is clear that genetic factors as well may help determine the balance between constrictive and adaptive or unfavorable and perfect remodeling in each case.
