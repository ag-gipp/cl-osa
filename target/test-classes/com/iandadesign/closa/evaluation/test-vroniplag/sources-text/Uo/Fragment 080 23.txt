Nordisk produced the expensive, spectacular film atlantis in 1913, directed by August Blom and based on a scenario of Gerhart Hauptmann. They rented a passenger boat and its entire crew for two months in order to shoot the sinking of a ship, evoking the Titanic tragedy, though the author had written the script before that disaster had happened, basing it on the story of the transatlantic liner Elba. The production costs amounted to the unprecedented sum of half a million of Danish crowns.3 [...] And here we come to the main reason for the influence of the Danish cinema: its actors, film stars such as Psilander or Asta Nielsen. They beat the competition offered by French stars such as Suzanne Grandais or Italian divas like Francesca Bertini and Lyda Borelli. Psilander died young at the age of 33 in 1917. He was a strong and good-looking man, full of charm and, what is more important, possessed a great talent in acting. He knew how to express sometimes complex feelings in gestures or by mimicking, not leaving the explanatory role to titles. 3 Aktion, vol. 4 (1914), p. 47.
