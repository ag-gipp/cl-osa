This brought him close to Bancroft, who also saw the early history of the United States mainly in terms of a renaissance of Teutonic, i.e. Anglo-Saxon, traditions of freedom — traditions which had for centuries been buried under the weight of European feudalism. Motley went further than that. His admiration for the continuity of Germanic traditions both in the Old and in the New World made him overlook all the contemporary differences between German and Anglo-American culture, so that he could exclaim: "Ever since the great rising for freedom against the Roman empire, down to this hour, Germany has been the main source of European and American culture. The common mother of nations and empires — alma mater felix prole — she still rules the thought of her vast brood of children; Franks, Goths, Saxons, Lombards, Normans, Netherlanders, Americans — Germans all."[FN 4] [FN 4: John L.
