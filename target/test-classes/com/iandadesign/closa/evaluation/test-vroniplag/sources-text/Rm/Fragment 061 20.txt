The High Court of Justiciary The High Court is Scotland's supreme criminal court. There is no appeal from it to the House of Lords. The judges of the High Court are the same as the judges of the Court of Session, but in their former capacity they are called Lord Commissioners of Justiciary, and wear different robes. The head of the court is the Lord Justice-General (who in the Court of Session is the Lord President) and the judge next in seniority is the Lord Justice-Clerk.
