Cancer [...] The SDR for cancer among males aged 0â€“64 years equalled the EU average and the average for the reference countries in the early 1970s. Since then, whereas the EU average has decreased, the rates in most reference countries have increased, with the increase in Hungary being the sharpest. Since 1990, the SDR has been considerably higher than in any other reference country, many of which have had declining rates. The increase in the SDR shows little sign of slowing down, and the differences from rates in other reference countries and from that in the EU have continued to increase because of the declining trend in these countries.
