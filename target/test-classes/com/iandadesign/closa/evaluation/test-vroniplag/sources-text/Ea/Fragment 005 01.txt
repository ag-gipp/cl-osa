Follow-up data for VTE recurrence in children are available from several reports12,13,17,62,63,67,69,78–81,93,100 and suggest a recurrence rate of &approx; 3% in neonates and 8% in older children. Unfortunately, the duration of follow-up is variable across studies. However, in the pediatric age group, it is unknown whether thrombus recurrence and other thrombotic outcomes in children are affected by IT; thus, it remains controversial whether children with thrombosis or offspring in thrombosis-prone families benefit from screening for IT.102–108 The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the impact of IT on VTE onset and recurrence in children as a prerequisite to the evaluation of primary and secondary treatment options through randomized controlled trials.
