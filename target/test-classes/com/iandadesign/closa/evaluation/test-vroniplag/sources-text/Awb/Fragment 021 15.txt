a) Vibration-induced force clamping Induction of a 4s sinusoidal vibration causes relaxation resulting from an increase in the rate of detachment of the actin-myosin cross-bridges. Vibration parameters (frequency: 65 Hz, amplitude: 8.5% ML, duration: 4 s) were appropriate to clamp the force output of the activated preparation at 10% of the previbration isometric force (27). Reattachment of the cross-bridges on the actin filament after cessation of vibration resulted in force generation. [ [EN 27]: Vahl, C. F., R. Bauernschmitt, and S.
