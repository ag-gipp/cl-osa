When Belgium was separated from Holland in 1830, the main bank then operating was the Société Générale, which "... dated from early in the nineteenth century, and under the Dutch sovereignity performed most of the financial operations of the Government. [...]" The new Belgian government initially continued to use the Société Générale as its bank, though the latter refused to accept any supervision from the government over its operations.[3] Not perhaps surprisingly, the government then supported the creation of a rival institution, the Bank of Belgium, in 1835, which was immediately allocated the role of banker to the government.[4]
