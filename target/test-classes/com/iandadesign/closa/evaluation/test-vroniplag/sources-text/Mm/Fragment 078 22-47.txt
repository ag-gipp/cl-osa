The emphasis on European-American continuity was still in many cases based on the religious motif. [S. 66] Both John William Draper and Andrew Dickson White projected an intellectual conflict of their own time into the Ancient and Medieval past of the Old World: the struggle between science and religion. [...] He was an evolutionist and a firm adherent of Comtean positivism. As the author of a History of the Intellectual Development of Europe (1863) and a concise History of the Conflict between Religion and Science (1874) he appears to the modern reader in the somewhat anachronistic role of a belated eighteenth century encyclopedist. His aim was to show the contrast between the dark "age of faith", which lasted to the end of the fifteenth century, and the enlightened "age of reason" which began with the Renaissance and found its fulfilment in modern America. White was less onesided in his historical views, but their general pattern was the same. This becomes obvious already in the title of his most significant historiographical achievement, the History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896). White was a professional historian who later became a leading university reformer and eventually a diplomat. He wrote on European history out of his sense of what was needed in America. As he says in his Autobiography (1905), he desired to confront his readers with the European past to help them "understand our own time and its problems in the light of history".2 In his treatment of the sources he was more critical than Draper, but like his older contemporary he sought to demonstrate the fundamental necessity of a liberal attitude in religious matters in order to secure cultural progress. Behind this pragmatic aspiration stood the conflicts which accompanied the foundation of Cornell University as a non-sectarian institution. Here, White was directly involvedÂ : he was the first president of this new American university. [FN] 2 Autobiography of Andrew Dickson White, New York, 1905, vol. 1, p. 83. [S. 67] The conjunction of growing historical criticism with the preservation of the thematic tradition found its most impressive demonstration in the works of Henry Charles Lea. [...] As a historian of institutions and more particularly of legal institutions he became a specialist on the history of ecclesiastical law. His greatest works were the History of the Inquisition in the Middle Ages (1888) and the History of the Inquistition in Spain (1906-7). [...] Unlike most of his professional contemporaries of the "scientific school", [...] he became one of the great masters of historical criticism and rose to international renown as well as to the presidency of the American Historical Association (1903).
