Since this duty of the United Kingdom courts to apply Community law derives from the European Comnmunities Act 1972, it would appear that Westminster Parliament could by subsequent legislation modify or abrogate that duty only if it expressed a direct intention to do so. That intention was not to be implied in the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 from the fact that its provisions were inconsistent with rights guaranteed by Community law. It would therefore be necessary for express words to be in a future statute should the Westminster Parliament wish to exercise what might be called its ultimate sovereign right to require British courts to depart from their duty to protect rights which arise under Community law. And it must be uncertain where the duty of the British courts would lie unless that statute also manifested the plainest intention by Parliament to leave the European Union.
