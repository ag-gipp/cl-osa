[ABBILDUNG, siehe hier] Fig. 3 Original registration of a constant-load experiment (mitral-valve stenosis). Under steady-state conditions (steady-state tension: 9 mN, including the passive tension of 2 mN) force is rapidly reduced to lower levels and held constant for 3 s (lower channel). During that period the muscle can shorten against this constant load until it is restreched to the initial length (upper channel). [...]
