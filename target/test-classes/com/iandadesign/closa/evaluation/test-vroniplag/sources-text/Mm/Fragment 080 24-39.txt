A number of these works have become classics in their field on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, eg Henry Osborn Taylor's Medieval Mind (1911) or Charles Homer Haskins's Renaissance of the Twelfth Century (1927), not to speak of that unique and truly "unclassifiable" masterpiece of the old Henry Adams, Mont- Saint-Michel and Chartres (1913). [...] Of particular importance was the American contribution to the history of medieval science, notably in the weighty volumes of George Sarton and Lynn Thorndike. Out of these works came a remarkably severe attack upon the Burckhardtian concept of the Renaissance. In their emphasis on the continuous and unbroken expansion of man's knowledge of nature, these American historians saw the Renaissance not as a new revival of intellectual forces but rather as a period of rest between the Middle Ages and the Enlightenment, or even as a period of regression.1 This "revolt of the medievalists" against the established pattern of historical periodization was parallelled by similar attempts at re-orientation in Europe, [...] Indeed, we observe American medievalists again and again [FN] 1 George Sarton, Introduction to the History of Science, 3 vols, in 5 parts, Baltimore, 1927-1948; Lynn Thorndike, A History of Magic and Experimental Science, 8 vols.

[S. 74] emphasizing the cultural unity of the Middle Ages in contrast to the diversity of the modem world. And in addition to this we find that the American medievalists of the 1920s and early 1930s were proudly conscious of the fact that the intellectual heritage of the Middle Ages belonged to them just as much as it belonged to the Europeans who seemed culturally closer to it. [S. 75] [...] agree with what Charles H. Haskins has already said in 1923: "Whether we look at Europe genetically as the source of our civilization, or pragmatically as a large part of the world [S. 76] in which we live, we cannot ignore the vital connections between Europe and America, their histories ultimately but one." 1
