But most electronic commerce is conducted through a combination of electronic channels (for example, telephone plus television or Internet plus telephone), in combination with paper (phone and mail), or in conjunction with physical shopping or delivery. Therefore, statistics on the sales revenue acquired through certain instruments of electronic commerce and other means of purchasing do not always reflect the full importance of each instrument for a commercial transaction as a whole. Another limitation of data on electronic commerce is their short historic record and the highly speculative nature of all forecasts. Consequently, we observe huge differences in the current numbers and forecasts for [the different instruments of] electronic commerce, and especially regarding the Internet. Data collection also focuses largely on the United States and some other main regions, and numbers for cross border transactions are unavailable. [...] One set of projections on electronic commerce suggests that by 1999, 13 per cent of all consumer “shopping” will be conducted electronically, and that this share will double to 26 per cent by 2007 (Financial Times, September 3, 1997; The Economist, May 10, 1997). In particular, the Internet is expected to expand its market share from 2 per cent of all electronic sales today to about 50 per cent in ten years time. [...] However, by 2002, Internet and other network-based commerce will comprise one quarter of all electronic sales.
