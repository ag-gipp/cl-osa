Finally, Oxman et al. (1995) examined the effects of religious attendance, importance of religion, and support derived from religion on six-month mortality rates for 232 older adults following elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The vast majority of participants were either Protestant (63%) or Catholic (25%). Only 5% of persons who attended religious services at least every few months died compared to 12% of those who never or rarely attended services (p= .06, uncontrolled). None of the persons who described themselves as deeply religious (n = 37), died, compared with an 11% mortality rate for other subjects (p = .04, uncontrolled). Six percent of those who obtained strength or comfort from religion died, compared to 16% of those who received no strength or comfort from religion (p = .01, uncontrolled). When other variables were controlled, including previous cardiac surgery, severity of ADL impairment, age, and social participation, persons who did not obtain strength or comfort from religion were three times more likely to die than those who depended on their religious faith (OR = 3.25). Even more striking, subjects who neither depended on religion for strength or comfort nor participated in social groups had a mortality risk more than 14 times that of persons who depended on religion and were involved in social groups (OR = 14.3) after biological and other risk factors were controlled.
