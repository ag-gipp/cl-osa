Products which can be delivered electronically are predicted a bright future. Online sale and downloading of software is mentioned most frequently in this context. Chart 3 above illustrates the considerable cost savings from conducting such transactions electronically. Competition is likely to force sellers to pass on these savings to consumers, who will also benefit from much faster delivery time. In fact, software ranks first among all goods and services retailed on the Internet (E-Land, 1997). Other sectors with potential for online distribution include publishing of newsletters, newspapers and magazines. Music and films (which have started to be sold online but delivered in a conventional manner) may soon be downloadable directly onto oneâ€™s computer or multimedia system at home. Online music sales may reach US$ 500 million by 2000.
