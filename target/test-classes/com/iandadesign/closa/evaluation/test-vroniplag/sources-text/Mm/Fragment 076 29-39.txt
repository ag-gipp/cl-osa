But the fact remains that in the whole Colonial and Revolutionary period no historical work on a European subject was written in America.[FN 4] II Not the Colonial but what is usually called the "National" period of American historiography saw the beginning of serious and comprehensive study also in the European Field. Famous names come to one's mind at once: Washington Irving, William Hickling Prescott, John Lothrop Motley. [...] Their aims were literary. They produced romantic works of art, full of pageantry and local colour. [...][FN 1] [...] Thus Irving wrote his Columbus (1828), Prescott rose to fame with his History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic (1838) and Motley produced his six volumes on the Netherlands' struggle for freedom and national independence (1856 ff).
